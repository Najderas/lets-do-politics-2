2016-04-01	Russ Gallegher Because a potential POTUS should only be prepared for one issue at a time, at a dullard's pace..... damn you trump-lickers are stupid.
2016-04-01	I hope Cruz is the GOP nominee. He would be easier for Hillary to beat than Trump.
2016-04-01	They both are likely to lose, but I think Trump would lose by a wider margin. That's what all the polls say at least.
2016-04-01	Daniel Warren Curtis I don't think so. If Cruz is the nominee Trump supporters will sit at home on election day. IMO
2016-04-01	Mark Wood Because they believe in America that much, right?
2016-04-01	It truly does not matter what the process is anymore. If Trump goes into the convention with more delegates than anyone else and looses the nomination the reaction will be fast and furious. The damage to the party that Trump has done is already a for gone conclusion allowed to happen by the GOP. What happens at the convention is only an extension of that failure.
2016-04-01	Agreed. The Republican Party is to blame for the rise of Trump. Trump, the GOP Presidential nominees, Priebus, Ryan, Republicans in Congress, and Republicans in general basically support the SAME unconscionable POLICIES. The blame lies primarily with the Republican Party, who support these monsters, that feeds on bigotry, fiscal irresponsibility, ignorance, warmongering, and HATE, media like FOX news, who welcomes/supports these ignorant Bigots.

2016-04-01	Daniel Williams NO, government in general is the reason for the rise in TRUMP. Government has done nothing but gridlock, politicians have lost touch with the taxpayers that support them, Vote themselves healthcare, retirement, excessive spending, etc. and then cast their power on the common people as if we are all idiots that need their expertise on every matter. the entitlements run rampent to the tune of $20T in overspending, honoring a democratic candidate that needs and will be arrested soon if it had not been for OBAMA sequester of the indictment papers, it would have already happened. TIRED of the same political maneuvers to get what they want. I believe the backlash will occur if Trump falls just short of 1237 and rightly so it should, shows the people's voice does not matter, but those of power and money take over.
2016-04-01	Daniel Neal no one is getting arrested, sweetie. Santa isn't coming. Settle,down.
2016-04-01	|For someone who says he is the best at everything ... especially at negotiation ... he seems to be losing the game.
Maybe Trump can offer delegates free tuition at Trump University, or free rides on Trump Airlines or a free suscription to Trump Magazine.

2016-04-01	Let’s be CLEAR folks: I and others like Bernie and he may win a few primaries, but he is weak on foreign policy issues, his promises are often not realistic, he speaks in generalities (while Hillary give specifics/details), etc. and odds are he will lose in the general election as a socialist.

Notice how the GOP is NOT attacking Bernie (who has been g...See More
2016-04-01	To even waste a thought that Bernie would be able to somehow get the nomination is completely and utterly ludicrous. The Democrat side has been chosen since Obama's last election in 2012. The Enabler has paid for this nomination and the DNC is more than happy to capitulate. It's more of a coranation than an actual election cycle. Our politics have become so horribly corrupt I can't imagine what things will be like in 20 years, we probably won't even vote by then.

2016-04-01	Smart move on their part in order to keep their stories straight. Fact of the matter is though that someone removed those classification markings from classified materials on order to send them over unsecure means to the clot. And due to the nature of some of the materials, the clot knew they were classified, but didn't mind sending the stuff on to her minions over her unsecured server. A quote was once used by Ben Franklin, a much more honoralbe person than this lot. "We must, indeed, all hang together, or we shall surely hang separately". Seems like this bunch has heard that somewhere. The noose is tightening

2016-04-01	And Bernie will still lose the democratic nomination.
2016-04-01	Perhaps....but Hillary is worried. Hence, her rather caustic "tone" today to the Greenpeace activist, who did not even represent the Bernie Sanders campaign. She was far ahead in Wisconsin, and will probably lose on Tuesday. Her lead in New York was over 30 points a couple of weeks ago, and yesterday, a poll had it down to 12, with 19 days still to go. And here is an interesting article from the LA Progressive on Hillary's so-called huge advantage of non-white voters: https://www.laprogressive.com/hillary-fading/...
2016-04-01	David Hart Winning by a small percentage does not help Sanders. He needs to win by large margins.
2016-04-01	William Johnson 57% of the vote is large margins?
2016-04-01	This will answer the question .. Can you buy an election? Does it matter where the money comes from? How do I know for sure the money comes from 'the people' .. ? I know this, I would never give a Lincoln penny to a politcian .. specially one that has lived off the taxpayers his entire life .. I don't think so.
2016-04-01	|Got it, you prefer corporate and special interest money funding elections.

I prefer public funding. It does matter where the money comes from. We will end Citizens United.|
2016-04-01	Jonathan West I would prefer people are not stupid and change this process where there is a CAP per month, per candidate -- no candidate should have an advantage in how much money they spend or collect-- they need to use ingenuity and skill on how they spend the same amount to get the word out.. A percentage must come from the public, and a percentage from businesses.
2016-04-01	Then where else is the money coming from? Under his mattress? Believe me, after all this time if Bernie's money was coming from anywhere else somewhere else, as much opposition as he's had from media and people like you, it would have been revealed by now. He's not hiding anything like Hillary Clinton who won't even release her speech transcripts for the voters to see. So that's an ignorant statement, but I can understand stupid statements about a candidate when one just wants to vote against his or her own best interest and vote for the candidate who will take them backwards and not forward. Go Bernie!!!
2016-04-01	He is good at getting his devoted true believers to cough up $; unfortunately, it is VOTES and DELEGATES that win the nomination. Even if Hillary's MILLIONS more voters do nothing but vote for her - she wins.
2016-04-01	....reminds me of a cheerleader who wants to end the game at halftime bc her team is ahead. Sorry, but people are waking up to what a douche Hillary really is. (Is "douche" a unisex term? Insert pantsuit joke here.) Hey here's a thought: do you really want to see this woman wearing pantsuits on TV every night until she gets impeached?
2016-04-01	You mean the couple million more when not accounting for caucus voters, since raw votes aren't released or sometimes even counted as an aggregate¿
2016-04-01	And if she wins the millions of bernie voters will vote Trump. :) #BernieOrBust
2016-04-01	2016 is hardly the ideal year for the Dems to nominate an open socialist - with the spectre of Trump in the opposition. Bernie clearly hasn't sealed the deal on selling his socialism to the country; his 'revolution' hasn't fully arrived as an obviously electable majority.
2016-04-01	Sanders polls significantly better vs. trump than Clinton does...
2016-04-01	Actually, national polling has him beating every republican competitor by a larger margin that Hillary does. Please stop regurgitating the unsupported time-warner (Clinton campaign donor) narrative that is a lie.

2016-04-01	Hillary Supporters remind me why I won't vote for her.
2016-04-01	Dude his campaign is not negative. If him pointing out legitimate differences between he and his opponent comes off as negative, then maybe she's just wrong on a few things andd by that i mean everything that she hasn't "adopted" ffrom Sanders yet. And as far as working for an oil company goes. Its not like an individual secretary for BP is gonna have enough money to cough up to legitimately fund a campaign. These people who work for these fuel companies funding her are "lobbyist and maybe executives". If it were a secretary, rig worker, or janitor it would go down as an individual donation not attached to some corporate entity. When i donate money to Bernie Sanders it goes down as an individual donation. They dont know who I work for and it wouldnt matter either.
2016-04-01	Sanders is lying about the fossil fuel donations. http://www.politico.com/.../hillary-clinton-bernie...
2016-04-01	|Read the whole thing. Those "employees" were LOBBYISTS for the fossil fuel industry. She's using the absolute loosest definition of the word employee to cover up that she has been given hundreds of thousands from those 57 people in addition to the millions the industry itself has given to her SuperPACs.
Of course the companies themselves haven't given directly to her campaign, they're not ALLOWED to, claiming that's what Sanders meant is beyond disingenuous.|
2016-04-01	|https://news.vice.com/.../fossil-fuel-investors-are...

The majority of fossil fuel donations have not been directly contributed to her campaign rather allocated through her second largest super PAC, Priorities USA Action.

2016-04-01	|Yes ... every time Bernie points out factual differences between he and hillary
out come the hillary whiners ...
Bernie did this and Bernie did that
Sounding more like the 5 year old Trump every day ...|
2016-04-01	|Facts make Hillary Clinton supporters uncomfortable, because all they have is typical Republican Tactics: misrepresentation, outright lying, hiding behind bullshit, etc.

When challenged in Policy, on the Issues, they shut up very quickly & begin to sling heavier insults of topics that have absolutely nothing to do with the candidate's Policies.

Guess what though? Americans are slowly waking up to that fact, and there's nothing you can do about it because enough of them are noticing that it is making a difference.

A big enough difference, that Clinton's foundation (Non-White votes) have dissolved as non-whites switch to Bernie Sanders.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/.../hillary-clintons...|
2016-04-01	|The longer the race goes on, the more it favors the candidate who represents the Truth. The more people get to know who he is, and when they do they switch over to him from Clinton very quickly. By the time he reaches California, he will have had enough time & so much money that everyone will know who he is, what he stands on, and the truth will obliterate Clinton as he overtakes her delegate lead & wins the nomination.

June 7th, the day Bernie Sanders is solidified as the future President of the United States.

And on that day? Oh, all the Hillbots & their Trump-Like behavior will just explode as they scramble to gather their collective head, "But HOW?! The MainStream Media promised us Clinton was 100% inevitable!? BUT HOW?!"

Math is how. Math, Truth, & Time.|
2016-04-01	A closed primary for registered democrats only, no way Bernie. Voter registration closed on the 25th of March.
2016-04-01	|And the deadline to change party affiliation to Democrat was October 9th; voter suppression anyone?

New York has one of the most cohesive party systems in the country, and you can bet the local Democrats will do everything in their power to stop Bernie Sanders from winning a state that Secretary Clinton really, really ought to win.

Good luck to them, because going to a college with over 18,000 students, I would bet that over 90% of us would support Bernie as our first choice. Unfortunately, due to the terribly constructed way the primary in New York is run, most of us are disenfranchised.

Great job Democrats, risking a prime opportunity to get the Millenials to support you for a generation in order to coronate Hillary.|
2016-04-01	Tom Planamento why is it voter suppression? These aren't new rules. They weren't implanted for the benefit of one candidate over another...
2016-04-01	Tom Planamento Why is a dealine voter suppression? Bills come with dealines.. if you miss it, does that mean you are now the subject of " payment suppression" because you didn't pay ontime? Homework for students has a dealine.. if you don't meet that deadline, is that now " student suppression"? Come on man.. if the youth want to truly be involved and have a voice, stop showing up late to the party and do some real investing. If people want to vote, they should invest the time to find out how, where, when and what are the requirments. Google is everyone's friend these days and it takes 3 mnutes. There always seems to be an excuse, but little aceptance of blame.
2016-04-01	Sanders is a fraud and no way in hell is he gonna win NEW YORK, fuck him and his socialism BS, you want to pay 5 or 6 bucks a gallon for fuel, or a 50% payroll tax move to Europe, that BS will never fly here, Clinton will soon get the nomination with wins in NY, Pennsylvania, DC, Maryland, Connecticut, then Jersey, California, Sanders is a poor mans Ben Carson, Garbage, I would vote for Trump before that senile old fuck..
2016-04-01	|In what world is Sanders proposing a 50% payroll tax or measures that would triple the cost of gas?

He's proposing a 2.4% payroll and measures that would marginally increase the cost of gas by

1) Reducing subsidies that go towards development of oil/NG production.
2) Creating a sort of trust where oil companies pay a portion of their revenue into it that would be used to fund environmental cleanup efforts and federal purchasing of land to expand national parks and reserves.|
2016-04-01	You'll be paying around $6,000 more per family
2016-04-01	Ignorant much?
2016-04-01	Wow the hubris. "She wins only in the South" well completing ignoring he only wins caucus states with large populations of whites?! I see his old ass starting to have early onset dementia. For him to try to disenfranchise voters and say they don't count because of a particular region is ludicrous. If Hillary had stated oh well he only wins lily white caucuses there would be a backlash but nope not God ole Bernie. GTFO here, I got 3 votes for HRC in NY yesterday and I'm going to work on getting more.
2016-04-01	Yes, only the south and red states. You know like southern Ohio, Iowa, mass, and let's remember Florida isn't important in the general.
2016-04-01	You are wrong. Washington is the 7th most diverse state, Hawaii has never had a majority white population, and Alaska is said to be one of the most diverse states in the country.
2016-04-01	Andrew Koss Virginia too
2016-04-01	|when hillary started losing in 2008
her supporters started calling Obama cuss words, a lot of nonsense in their comments
had nothing good to say about the President that hillary would, "then serve" for the next 4 years
Maybe we can get Bernie to hold some minor position open for her too ...|
2016-04-01	Hillary DID end up campaigning for Obama far more than any other nomination runner up did for the nominee in any election year. I bet Sanders won't campaign at all for Hillary if she ends up being the nominee.

2016-04-01	|Well that is an honest statement. Kasich is not insane. If it came down to choosing between Hillary and Kasich..... yeeesh...... I might actually support Kasich to keep Hillary out, not that I would feel good about it. As much as I find kasich vile and repugnant, he is less repugnant than Hillary.

The set-backs that would come form a Kasich presidency would be more easily undone than the selling us out and backstabbing that Hillary would do. I will never be able to forgive her for BAPCPA.|
2016-04-01	Bryan yes, Governor Kasich is the adult in the room. But his views on public education, a women's right to choose, he is anti union, he is supported by ALEC and the Koch brothers who not only have libertarian points of view but are also influenced by John Birtch Society values and goals. His part in Lehman brothers and the collapse of the American economy in 2008 is still suspect. The setbacks from a kasich administration would not easily be undone. All one has to do is look at George W. we are still trying to recover from him. With all due respect.
2016-04-01	Neal Levine you may be right. I guess I just would have to decide in that instance if I would rather be betrayed by Hillary or just out right abused. Either way, it would suck. That would not be an easy choice. Thankfully for me I live in a thoroughly blue state so I have guilt free voting for third party candidates or write in. Those in closer contests..... yuck, I do not envy them.
2016-04-01	|As a liberal Democrat myself, I don't find kasich vile and repugnant at all. I obviously do not agree with many of his positions, but from what I do know of the man, I can't help but agree with Sanders 100% on this: he's not crazy. His arguments are sound, and he hardly ever engages in formal logical fallacies like everyone else does.

He has demonstrated, times and time again, the ability to work with the opposition in order to accomplish the ultimate goal: governing this nation. He has worked with Bill Clinton throughout the 90s, and vice-versa.

That is what I expect of ALL Congresspeople...See More|
2016-04-01	What an important and informative line of questioning from our friends in the media. Thank you Politico for relaying this meaningful story about Bernie Sanders opinions of candidates he isn't currently running against.
2016-04-01	Bernie is awesome, when he's not protecting Gun Makers and Gun Sellers, he supporting men who defund Planned Parenthood
2016-04-01	saying he is not insane is hardly what i would call an endorsemnt.

2016-04-01	|Bernie's out in the states meeting with the real people that matter and connecting with the electorate in a genuine way, not worried about wooing the wealthy. His polls are soaring up, not down, and we're exceeding expectation all around... had 5 landslides by a 40-60 point margin in a row all over the West Coast and Hawaii! He's now 4 points ahead of Clinton in Wisconsin, that doesn't sound like he's losing one bit, does it?

Never mind the fact that he had record turnout in The Bronx, just like what we're seeing in California, massive turnouts for Bernie all over the state.

http://thehill.com/.../274689-poll-sanders-leads-clinton...|
2016-04-01	Sanders just likes ethics and honesty, that's why this issue is of any concern to him. Don't call someone a liar when they're being factually accurate.
2016-04-01	Fuck Sanders Clinton doesn't owe him shit, why doesn't Sanders tell everyone and everybody how much he will raise taxes to pay for the free shit hes been promising to give away???? Sanders is too old and a fraud who has 0 foreign policy experience, LOL, I would vote for Trump over his old ass, cmon Hillary only 600 delegates and your there!!!

2016-04-01	I'm sure that at least one of the people who has donated to Bernie Sanders has been convicted of DUI. WHY ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF DRUNK DRIVING, SENATOR?
2016-04-01	|First, obviously that metaphor makes little sense. But still, nobody with a DUI is lobbying DC to make sure DUIs get eliminated. The fossil fuel industry is actively trying to suppress environmental causes.

Second, the activist who started this by approaching Clinton was from Greenpeace. They are NOT coordinating with the Sanders campaign and have their own agenda when it comes to the environment - in fact, they've been asking Clinton for months to sign the same pledge Martin O'Malley and Sanders did to not take any money from fracking or the fossil fuel industry. Clinton still has not signed this.|
2016-04-01	|Nathan Deming It makes perfect sense, because it's also an extreme distortion of reality.

As for your precious pledge, Bernie has received money from people who work in the fossil fuel industry. So he's got suppressing environmental causes on his agenda, right?|
2016-04-01	Nathan Deming It actually does make sense. Clinton is insinuating that money coming from workers in an industry is the same as money coming from CEOs and professional lobbyists from that same industry. Lobbyists are professional investors, workers are not.
2016-04-01	Carson has been bribed and addmnitted it at first. Now that he has found out that it is illegal he backpedals - just like Trump.
2016-04-01	You don't know what you're talking about. His comments were unspecific. You weren't part of the conversation between Trump and Carson. Specifcally, which comment of Carson's is a direct quote from his meeting with Trump? You don't know because you weren't there. Quit making making up facts.
2016-04-01	Michael Rehkamp Carson addmitted that before his endorsedment that thye talkeda about a position. Then he endorsed Trump who had been spending a lot of time insulting himm. No one does that unless they were bribed.
2016-04-01	If anyone accuses Carson without any basis just afraid if he is offered a position he takes away black votes from Clinton so they are coming with new strategy

2016-04-01	Another desperate farce by political establishment and insiders---that's the reason they must GO! They'er trying to undermine or understand every defeat that Trump delivered to them with smear. Carson and Trump were the only two non-politicians initially running and have been long time friends in Florida even before they entered the race. They'er both accomplished and respected. If Trump wants to offer Carson a position and Carson accepts--so be it! There is no bribe---just mutual respect! Stigmatizing everyone around Trump in order to isolate Trump to try to bring him down, will not work!
