2016-04-01	Russ Gallegher Because a potential POTUS should only be prepared for one issue at a time, at a dullard's pace..... damn you trump-lickers are stupid.
2016-04-01	I hope Cruz is the GOP nominee. He would be easier for Hillary to beat than Trump.
2016-04-01	They both are likely to lose, but I think Trump would lose by a wider margin. That's what all the polls say at least.
2016-04-01	Daniel Warren Curtis I don't think so. If Cruz is the nominee Trump supporters will sit at home on election day. IMO
2016-04-01	Mark Wood Because they believe in America that much, right?
2016-04-01	It truly does not matter what the process is anymore. If Trump goes into the convention with more delegates than anyone else and looses the nomination the reaction will be fast and furious. The damage to the party that Trump has done is already a for gone conclusion allowed to happen by the GOP. What happens at the convention is only an extension of that failure.
2016-04-01	Agreed. The Republican Party is to blame for the rise of Trump. Trump, the GOP Presidential nominees, Priebus, Ryan, Republicans in Congress, and Republicans in general basically support the SAME unconscionable POLICIES. The blame lies primarily with the Republican Party, who support these monsters, that feeds on bigotry, fiscal irresponsibility, ignorance, warmongering, and HATE, media like FOX news, who welcomes/supports these ignorant Bigots.

2016-04-01	Daniel Williams NO, government in general is the reason for the rise in TRUMP. Government has done nothing but gridlock, politicians have lost touch with the taxpayers that support them, Vote themselves healthcare, retirement, excessive spending, etc. and then cast their power on the common people as if we are all idiots that need their expertise on every matter. the entitlements run rampent to the tune of $20T in overspending, honoring a democratic candidate that needs and will be arrested soon if it had not been for OBAMA sequester of the indictment papers, it would have already happened. TIRED of the same political maneuvers to get what they want. I believe the backlash will occur if Trump falls just short of 1237 and rightly so it should, shows the people's voice does not matter, but those of power and money take over.
2016-04-01	Daniel Neal no one is getting arrested, sweetie. Santa isn't coming. Settle,down.
2016-04-01	|For someone who says he is the best at everything ... especially at negotiation ... he seems to be losing the game.
Maybe Trump can offer delegates free tuition at Trump University, or free rides on Trump Airlines or a free suscription to Trump Magazine.

2016-04-01	Let’s be CLEAR folks: I and others like Bernie and he may win a few primaries, but he is weak on foreign policy issues, his promises are often not realistic, he speaks in generalities (while Hillary give specifics/details), etc. and odds are he will lose in the general election as a socialist.

Notice how the GOP is NOT attacking Bernie (who has been g...See More
2016-04-01	To even waste a thought that Bernie would be able to somehow get the nomination is completely and utterly ludicrous. The Democrat side has been chosen since Obama's last election in 2012. The Enabler has paid for this nomination and the DNC is more than happy to capitulate. It's more of a coranation than an actual election cycle. Our politics have become so horribly corrupt I can't imagine what things will be like in 20 years, we probably won't even vote by then.
2016-04-01	|Zach and Daniel, you two could not be more ignorant of the current situation. His views on foreign policy are pretty clear from the debates and from what he's posted on his website.

2016-04-01	Smart move on their part in order to keep their stories straight. Fact of the matter is though that someone removed those classification markings from classified materials on order to send them over unsecure means to the clot. And due to the nature of some of the materials, the clot knew they were classified, but didn't mind sending the stuff on to her minions over her unsecured server. A quote was once used by Ben Franklin, a much more honoralbe person than this lot. "We must, indeed, all hang together, or we shall surely hang separately". Seems like this bunch has heard that somewhere. The noose is tightening

2016-04-01	And Bernie will still lose the democratic nomination.
2016-04-01	Perhaps....but Hillary is worried. Hence, her rather caustic "tone" today to the Greenpeace activist, who did not even represent the Bernie Sanders campaign. She was far ahead in Wisconsin, and will probably lose on Tuesday. Her lead in New York was over 30 points a couple of weeks ago, and yesterday, a poll had it down to 12, with 19 days still to go. And here is an interesting article from the LA Progressive on Hillary's so-called huge advantage of non-white voters: https://www.laprogressive.com/hillary-fading/...
2016-04-01	David Hart Winning by a small percentage does not help Sanders. He needs to win by large margins.
2016-04-01	William Johnson 57% of the vote is large margins?
2016-04-01	This will answer the question .. Can you buy an election? Does it matter where the money comes from? How do I know for sure the money comes from 'the people' .. ? I know this, I would never give a Lincoln penny to a politcian .. specially one that has lived off the taxpayers his entire life .. I don't think so.
2016-04-01	|Got it, you prefer corporate and special interest money funding elections.

I prefer public funding. It does matter where the money comes from. We will end Citizens United.|
2016-04-01	Jonathan West I would prefer people are not stupid and change this process where there is a CAP per month, per candidate -- no candidate should have an advantage in how much money they spend or collect-- they need to use ingenuity and skill on how they spend the same amount to get the word out.. A percentage must come from the public, and a percentage from businesses.
2016-04-01	Then where else is the money coming from? Under his mattress? Believe me, after all this time if Bernie's money was coming from anywhere else somewhere else, as much opposition as he's had from media and people like you, it would have been revealed by now. He's not hiding anything like Hillary Clinton who won't even release her speech transcripts for the voters to see. So that's an ignorant statement, but I can understand stupid statements about a candidate when one just wants to vote against his or her own best interest and vote for the candidate who will take them backwards and not forward. Go Bernie!!!
2016-04-01	He is good at getting his devoted true believers to cough up $; unfortunately, it is VOTES and DELEGATES that win the nomination. Even if Hillary's MILLIONS more voters do nothing but vote for her - she wins.
2016-04-01	....reminds me of a cheerleader who wants to end the game at halftime bc her team is ahead. Sorry, but people are waking up to what a douche Hillary really is. (Is "douche" a unisex term? Insert pantsuit joke here.) Hey here's a thought: do you really want to see this woman wearing pantsuits on TV every night until she gets impeached?
2016-04-01	You mean the couple million more when not accounting for caucus voters, since raw votes aren't released or sometimes even counted as an aggregate¿
2016-04-01	And if she wins the millions of bernie voters will vote Trump. :) #BernieOrBust
2016-04-01	2016 is hardly the ideal year for the Dems to nominate an open socialist - with the spectre of Trump in the opposition. Bernie clearly hasn't sealed the deal on selling his socialism to the country; his 'revolution' hasn't fully arrived as an obviously electable majority.
2016-04-01	Sanders polls significantly better vs. trump than Clinton does...
2016-04-01	Actually, national polling has him beating every republican competitor by a larger margin that Hillary does. Please stop regurgitating the unsupported time-warner (Clinton campaign donor) narrative that is a lie.

2016-04-01	Hillary Supporters remind me why I won't vote for her.
2016-04-01	Dude his campaign is not negative. If him pointing out legitimate differences between he and his opponent comes off as negative, then maybe she's just wrong on a few things andd by that i mean everything that she hasn't "adopted" ffrom Sanders yet. And as far as working for an oil company goes. Its not like an individual secretary for BP is gonna have enough money to cough up to legitimately fund a campaign. These people who work for these fuel companies funding her are "lobbyist and maybe executives". If it were a secretary, rig worker, or janitor it would go down as an individual donation not attached to some corporate entity. When i donate money to Bernie Sanders it goes down as an individual donation. They dont know who I work for and it wouldnt matter either.
2016-04-01	Sanders is lying about the fossil fuel donations. http://www.politico.com/.../hillary-clinton-bernie...
2016-04-01	|Read the whole thing. Those "employees" were LOBBYISTS for the fossil fuel industry. She's using the absolute loosest definition of the word employee to cover up that she has been given hundreds of thousands from those 57 people in addition to the millions the industry itself has given to her SuperPACs.
Of course the companies themselves haven't given directly to her campaign, they're not ALLOWED to, claiming that's what Sanders meant is beyond disingenuous.|
2016-04-01	|https://news.vice.com/.../fossil-fuel-investors-are...

The majority of fossil fuel donations have not been directly contributed to her campaign rather allocated through her second largest super PAC, Priorities USA Action.

out come the hillary whiners ...
Bernie did this and Bernie did that
Sounding more like the 5 year old Trump every day ...|
2016-04-01	|Facts make Hillary Clinton supporters uncomfortable, because all they have is typical Republican Tactics: misrepresentation, outright lying, hiding behind bullshit, etc.

When challenged in Policy, on the Issues, they shut up very quickly & begin to sling heavier insults of topics that have absolutely nothing to do with the candidate's Policies.

Guess what though? Americans are slowly waking up to that fact, and there's nothing you can do about it because enough of them are noticing that it is making a difference.

A big enough difference, that Clinton's foundation (Non-White votes) have dissolved as non-whites switch to Bernie Sanders.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/.../hillary-clintons...|
2016-04-01	|The longer the race goes on, the more it favors the candidate who represents the Truth. The more people get to know who he is, and when they do they switch over to him from Clinton very quickly. By the time he reaches California, he will have had enough time & so much money that everyone will know who he is, what he stands on, and the truth will obliterate Clinton as he overtakes her delegate lead & wins the nomination.

June 7th, the day Bernie Sanders is solidified as the future President of the United States.

And on that day? Oh, all the Hillbots & their Trump-Like behavior will just explode as they scramble to gather their collective head, "But HOW?! The MainStream Media promised us Clinton was 100% inevitable!? BUT HOW?!"

Math is how. Math, Truth, & Time.|
2016-04-01	A closed primary for registered democrats only, no way Bernie. Voter registration closed on the 25th of March.
2016-04-01	|And the deadline to change party affiliation to Democrat was October 9th; voter suppression anyone?

New York has one of the most cohesive party systems in the country, and you can bet the local Democrats will do everything in their power to stop Bernie Sanders from winning a state that Secretary Clinton really, really ought to win.

Good luck to them, because going to a college with over 18,000 students, I would bet that over 90% of us would support Bernie as our first choice. Unfortunately, due to the terribly constructed way the primary in New York is run, most of us are disenfranchised.

Great job Democrats, risking a prime opportunity to get the Millenials to support you for a generation in order to coronate Hillary.|
2016-04-01	Tom Planamento why is it voter suppression? These aren't new rules. They weren't implanted for the benefit of one candidate over another...
2016-04-01	Tom Planamento Why is a dealine voter suppression? Bills come with dealines.. if you miss it, does that mean you are now the subject of " payment suppression" because you didn't pay ontime? Homework for students has a dealine.. if you don't meet that deadline, is that now " student suppression"? Come on man.. if the youth want to truly be involved and have a voice, stop showing up late to the party and do some real investing. If people want to vote, they should invest the time to find out how, where, when and what are the requirments. Google is everyone's friend these days and it takes 3 mnutes. There always seems to be an excuse, but little aceptance of blame.
2016-04-01	Sanders is a fraud and no way in hell is he gonna win NEW YORK, fuck him and his socialism BS, you want to pay 5 or 6 bucks a gallon for fuel, or a 50% payroll tax move to Europe, that BS will never fly here, Clinton will soon get the nomination with wins in NY, Pennsylvania, DC, Maryland, Connecticut, then Jersey, California, Sanders is a poor mans Ben Carson, Garbage, I would vote for Trump before that senile old fuck..
2016-04-01	|In what world is Sanders proposing a 50% payroll tax or measures that would triple the cost of gas?

He's proposing a 2.4% payroll and measures that would marginally increase the cost of gas by

1) Reducing subsidies that go towards development of oil/NG production.
2) Creating a sort of trust where oil companies pay a portion of their revenue into it that would be used to fund environmental cleanup efforts and federal purchasing of land to expand national parks and reserves.|
2016-04-01	You'll be paying around $6,000 more per family
2016-04-01	Ignorant much?
2016-04-01	Wow the hubris. "She wins only in the South" well completing ignoring he only wins caucus states with large populations of whites?! I see his old ass starting to have early onset dementia. For him to try to disenfranchise voters and say they don't count because of a particular region is ludicrous. If Hillary had stated oh well he only wins lily white caucuses there would be a backlash but nope not God ole Bernie. GTFO here, I got 3 votes for HRC in NY yesterday and I'm going to work on getting more.
2016-04-01	Yes, only the south and red states. You know like southern Ohio, Iowa, mass, and let's remember Florida isn't important in the general.
2016-04-01	You are wrong. Washington is the 7th most diverse state, Hawaii has never had a majority white population, and Alaska is said to be one of the most diverse states in the country.
2016-04-01	Andrew Koss Virginia too
2016-04-01	|when hillary started losing in 2008
her supporters started calling Obama cuss words, a lot of nonsense in their comments
had nothing good to say about the President that hillary would, "then serve" for the next 4 years
Maybe we can get Bernie to hold some minor position open for her too ...|
2016-04-01	Hillary DID end up campaigning for Obama far more than any other nomination runner up did for the nominee in any election year. I bet Sanders won't campaign at all for Hillary if she ends up being the nominee.

2016-04-01	|Well that is an honest statement. Kasich is not insane. If it came down to choosing between Hillary and Kasich..... yeeesh...... I might actually support Kasich to keep Hillary out, not that I would feel good about it. As much as I find kasich vile and repugnant, he is less repugnant than Hillary.

The set-backs that would come form a Kasich presidency would be more easily undone than the selling us out and backstabbing that Hillary would do. I will never be able to forgive her for BAPCPA.|
2016-04-01	Bryan yes, Governor Kasich is the adult in the room. But his views on public education, a women's right to choose, he is anti union, he is supported by ALEC and the Koch brothers who not only have libertarian points of view but are also influenced by John Birtch Society values and goals. His part in Lehman brothers and the collapse of the American economy in 2008 is still suspect. The setbacks from a kasich administration would not easily be undone. All one has to do is look at George W. we are still trying to recover from him. With all due respect.
2016-04-01	Neal Levine you may be right. I guess I just would have to decide in that instance if I would rather be betrayed by Hillary or just out right abused. Either way, it would suck. That would not be an easy choice. Thankfully for me I live in a thoroughly blue state so I have guilt free voting for third party candidates or write in. Those in closer contests..... yuck, I do not envy them.
2016-04-01	|As a liberal Democrat myself, I don't find kasich vile and repugnant at all. I obviously do not agree with many of his positions, but from what I do know of the man, I can't help but agree with Sanders 100% on this: he's not crazy. His arguments are sound, and he hardly ever engages in formal logical fallacies like everyone else does.

He has demonstrated, times and time again, the ability to work with the opposition in order to accomplish the ultimate goal: governing this nation. He has worked with Bill Clinton throughout the 90s, and vice-versa.

That is what I expect of ALL Congresspeople...See More|

He's now 4 points ahead of Clinton in Wisconsin, that doesn't sound like he's losing one bit, does it?

2016-04-01	I'm sure that at least one of the people who has donated to Bernie Sanders has been convicted of DUI. WHY ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF DRUNK DRIVING, SENATOR?
2016-04-01	|First, obviously that metaphor makes little sense. But still, nobody with a DUI is lobbying DC to make sure DUIs get eliminated. The fossil fuel industry is actively trying to suppress environmental causes.

Second, the activist who started this by approaching Clinton was from Greenpeace. They are NOT coordinating with the Sanders campaign and have their own agenda when it comes to the environment - in fact, they've been asking Clinton for months to sign the same pledge Martin O'Malley and Sanders did to not take any money from fracking or the fossil fuel industry. Clinton still has not signed this.|
2016-04-01	|Nathan Deming It makes perfect sense, because it's also an extreme distortion of reality.

As for your precious pledge, Bernie has received money from people who work in the fossil fuel industry. So he's got suppressing environmental causes on his agenda, right?|
2016-04-01	Nathan Deming It actually does make sense. Clinton is insinuating that money coming from workers in an industry is the same as money coming from CEOs and professional lobbyists from that same industry. Lobbyists are professional investors, workers are not.
2016-04-01	Carson has been bribed and addmnitted it at first. Now that he has found out that it is illegal he backpedals - just like Trump.

Specifcally, which comment of Carson's is a direct quote from his meeting with Trump? You don't know because you weren't there. Quit making making up facts.
2016-04-01	Michael Rehkamp Carson addmitted that before his endorsedment that thye talkeda about a position. Then he endorsed Trump who had been spending a lot of time insulting himm. No one does that unless they were bribed.
2016-04-01	If anyone accuses Carson without any basis just afraid if he is offered a position he takes away black votes from Clinton so they are coming with new strategy

2016-04-01	You must be a racist to call someone a racist
2016-04-01	Mashu Murty No, just his backing a bigot and racist puts him down in the mud, too. Besides your comment is absurd.

2016-04-01	And himslef...Mr. Moderate who nevr met an ALEC bill he wouldn't sign in the dead of night.

2016-04-01	So is Ted.
2016-04-01	"We can't communicat ewith them directly, but I've told them.." who's the liar, Governor?
2016-04-01	Actually, he's not lying on that one. Legally, a candidate cannot have contact with a super PAC supporting them. It's because super PACs are supposed to be independant from the campaign since they are advertising on behalf of the candidate and skirting donation caps.
2016-04-01	Jai Sutton But it sure sounds like contortions in the extreme - we cant communicate with them directly but we've communicated with them - which is it?
2016-04-01	While acknowledging that he cannot directly communicate with the group, he told reporters, "I've told my people to communicate that I’m very unhappy with that word."
2016-04-01	Kasich2016!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2016-04-01	He is going to have to win a lot more than he has to ever win...but he is probably one o the few candidates that have any chance against either Democrat. Trump or Cruz would be crushed.
2016-04-01	Mark Keeler YAY for paid pawns.
2016-04-01	Ted Cruz is the worst. I would rather have anyone(Trump to Bernie to that scallywag hilliary). Thats how much I think Cruz is detremental to this country. His wife being a sorry excuse for a human being(goldman sachs) doesnt help his cause.
2016-04-01	Rick Honaker What are you talking about, I called her a Scallywag. when did I say I like her. I think she will be a sub-par President, where I think Teddy boy will be the end to US as we know it.
2016-04-01	Rick Honaker Maybe she can help the Chinese out more and they can be better equipped to win the WW3. I know everyone has been waiting for that. Ted Crazy is just Ted Crazy.
2016-04-01	They need to laugh in his face. It was Cruz that said himself that he's a Christian first, American second. He needs to get his money from Christian organizations and donors.
2016-04-01	Yeah, one day conservative Jewish Americans who have cynically supported the right wing, just because the right supports Israel - one day they may regret it. The fervent wish of evangelicals is that all Jews be converted. The American Jewish right wing is possibly sacrificing its long-term interests for short-term gains. The Christian evangelical mission is to get rid of anyone not like them - anyone and everyone. They have the same aims as fundamentalists of any religion.
2016-04-01	I think before he goes he needs to disavow Ted Nugent. Ted Nugent is a fierce anti-semite and if one has read his web page one would know that Ted hates jews. So far Ted Cruz has not disavowed Mr Nugent at all. Mr. Cruz has also been condemned by the anti-defamation league for singling out Muslim Neighborhoods in the United States for added Police scrutiny. As the anti-defamation league put it that it would be throwback to the 1930s and 1940s in Nazi Germany. And this is who the GOP is turning to instead of Donald Trump. Truly you can't make this stuff up.
2016-04-01	the real criminals are all the settlers in Israel. what they are doing to the Palastinians is the new holocaust. Especially the ones who are going out of the zones and making colonies on arab zoned land, and then they wonder why the arabs are mad. I am not a Ted Nugent fan and I am no Anti-semite. I believe in piece, and I believe in what I think is right. There is no way any one can explain to me how the new "settlers" are right in what they are doing in Israel.
2016-04-01	Patrick Dannunzio it takes two for a two state solution. Until there is a willing partner it is what it is.
2016-04-01	Patrick Dannunzio agreed

2016-04-01	Hope he let's them in on the fact that Rafael has said Christians must be in control of all sectors of society (Seven Mountains mandate) so the end times will come. Ted is annointed King to bring back the spoils of war to the priest.. I can't wait for the transfer of wealth from the wicked to the righteous gentiles; according to Rafeal. Once they get this all worked out then Jesus can come back. Right befor he does luckily the Jews will be given the chance to convert so there is that. Cruz= Dominionist
2016-04-01	I don't understand why we let Jewish interests flood our policy. Let Israel handle their own problems that they caused. Now if the arabs just go attacking children and what not, then sure help, but if the arabs are attacking because these new "settlers" are taking their land, then #uck them, that is their own agenda and problem. This is sopposed to be a christian country.

2016-04-01	So in your eyes, trump and cruz are equally as bad as Sanders and Clinton? If so I can't take you seriously .
2016-04-01	|Carl Rice Equally? Equally is meaningless. They're all bad. Varying degrees of bad, but bad.

In other words, they don't all suck equally, but they all most definitely suck.|
2016-04-01	|Sanders = naive
Hillary = corrupt, compulsive liar
Trump = clueless
Cruz = shady

Yup, they all suck.|
2016-04-01	you forgot to add corrupt, compulsive liar to Trump as well
2016-04-01	Oh brother... the ol "liar" talking point yet NOBODY can say what she allegedly LIED about?? And what CORRUPTIONS?? Really? They are so obvious that everyone didn't do anything about it?? Sanders has been in Politics 40 years, he knows a lot more than your dumb ass

2016-04-01	|Roger Crawford
Trump’s statements were awarded PolitiFact’s 2015 Lie of the Year.
http://www.politifact.com/.../2015-lie-year-donald-trump.../|
2016-04-01	Roger Crawford yes, exactly right. Rush has built a career out of falsely accusing both Clintons of everything from rape to murder to drug trafficking.
2016-04-01	Hope he included himself in that..
2016-04-01	He is not running for the Presidency. Try to do better at deflection next time.
2016-04-01	Roger Crawford But he does suck, though
2016-04-01	Ed Johnson No real disagreement on my part. Carry on. You and I typically disagree. But in this case, I find no fault in what you are saying. Carry on my liberal "friend" .
2016-04-01	She is just a liar
2016-04-01	Hugh Johnson I don't have to worry about that, Hugh.....
2016-04-01	Roy Ellis Every article says that Bernie is lying about her record. Its politics and its not the first tim ehes done that. factcheck.org has plenty of examples besides this one.
2016-04-01	Henri Lem Hilary is a liar, Henri.....it is as simple as that
2016-04-01	That is true. We don't need to turn into the tea party people. I getting real uncomfortable with this purist angle Bernie people are going with. We are a big tent party. I dont want us turning into the republican party. They are basically eating their own. We don't need that on our side.
2016-04-01	The point is that our system for campaign financing is corrupt and designed to protect the large donors by allowing them to remain anonymous
2016-04-01	John Michael Baró Obviously Hilary's donors are not annonymous or we woudln't have this article
2016-04-01	Benjamin, there is nothing PURE about Sanders, Weaver, and Devine. Weaver and Devine just want to keep going so they can get their huge paychecks. February, for example, Devine, paid $810,000!!! Not bad for one month. What about Sanders? Pure? Has he turned back any of the $176,000 pay from the US Senate, paid by you and me, for work he never, ever goes to? When did he last vote? How many days has he missed in DC? Pure? No way. Read Nate Silver at 538 today - good column - Sanders will have great trouble even getting close to the delegates needed for nomination, and he won't be allowed to STEAL them. Pure? Not that bunch.
2016-04-01	And what they don't show you is the millions that get poured into various pro-Clinton PACs by leaders of the industry. Whats so corrupt about the whole campaign finance system is that there really is no $2700 if you can donate unlimited amounts to a PAC; in addition to the absurdity that a cap on donations exists, its only with direct donations to the campaign (the 2700) in which your name & occupation is disclosed. PACs do not have to disclose any information about who their donors are
2016-04-01	|Hugh Johnson Congratulations...everyone can post links http://www.ontheissues.org/.../Bernie_Sanders_Energy...

Still doesn't change the fact that some of her biggest bundlers for fundraising are deeply involved in fracking|
2016-04-01	Sanders is losing and he knows it, so here comes the lying. He is followed by a bunch of un-informed idiots who are listening to the Pied Piper.

2016-04-01	sanders is a true socialist!-I'm voting for a real democrat PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON
2016-04-01	Good for you. Being so against Socialism I suggest you also give up your Social Security, never use public roads, public parks, tear up your library card, never call the fire department, don't listen to anything coming from public air waves, don't use the sewer and water system and most importantly, don't expect Socialsm to bail out the financial system the next time Capitalism fails.
2016-04-01	|Steve Zagata
Sweetie I and my employers paid for 50 years into Social Security. It's not free.
And neither is Medicare. I pay over $200 a month for the pleasure.
Now let's talk about all that really free stuff Bernie wants to use my
taxes dollars to pay for things to give to you.|
2016-04-01	Steve Zagata That's just silly. Hillary and Bernie have voted the same way 93% of the time. Nowhere in Hillary's platform will public roads, parks and libraries go away. Try to stick to reality when arguing. Yours is an argument full of logical fallacies.

2016-04-01	I find it amusing that after 8 months of campaigning the GOP is acting unified to defeat Donald Trump. Even though the damage has been done. To little to late because their knight in shinning armor is none other than drumb roll please. Mini Trump who wants to put more police in Muslim Neighborhoods, who wants no exceptions for abortions like the health of the mother, rape or incest. Yes Mini Trump the savior of the GOP.

2016-04-01	The GOP are already toast in this election circle and they know it. Their focus now is the long term. They are doing their best to minimize the damages Trump and his supporters are currently doing to their brand. At a time when they need to attract a more diverse support base their front runner is busy alienating all relevant voting blocks with the exception of white men. The Republicans are not going to recover from this any time soon.
2016-04-01	|Abdulai Bah : "Their focus now is the long term."
==================

What kind of long term focus? Hating Latinos? That is a recipe for political suicide.|
2016-04-01	My fellow Americans! I too had an approval of Mr. Trump to run. But during the course of these last few months I must admit his naivete in regards to politics is going to be his undoing and as well a little dangerous. I understand the anger and frustration of my fellow Americans with our government but to put someone in charge with the most important job in the free world of any countries on this planet is frankly too dangerous for me to cast a vote for him. Republican or Democrat Think very carefully my friends regarding the vote for November!!
2016-04-01	I up voted you and I welcome you to sanity.
2016-04-01	The US Chamber of Commerce is in bed with cheap labor and open borders...Who cares what they think? Besides..most Americans are already experiencing a recession..It's never ended. They will do and say anything to disrupt the Trump train..much like the media and the establishment GOP...Remember they are implimenting their 100 day program against Trump...What we have on our side is voter enthusiam...Don't listen to any of their rhetoric..get to the polls folks!
2016-04-01	In your rambling incoherent attack-the-messenger nonresponse, you shockingly fail to rebut the premise that tariffs spark a trade war, or at best, causes retailers to raise prices and pass the increased expenses directly on to the consumer.
2016-04-01	I hope your enthusiasm will keep you warm and pay the bills when the SHTF if we should be so cursed as to have Trump elected President. You say don't listen to the rhetoric, what the hell do you have against common sense? Never mind, if you had any common sense, you wouldn't be a Trump supporter.
2016-04-01	Michael Eisenberg Rambling and incoherent rant??..Comprehension problems?? Do tell...what will happen in seven years with California raising the minimum wage of $15 dollars for burger flippers?? How does that work? Won't that cause retailers to raise prices and pass increased expenses directly on to the consumer as well?? I think trade deals are the least of our problems with progressives running the country..
2016-04-01	Trump has little understanding of economics. It has been often reported that if he had taken the fortune he inherited from his daddy and simply let it sit in a no-brainer index fund, he would be richer than he is today.
2016-04-01	Actually at "Trump has little understanding of_______" Just fill in the blank and you're going to be right.
2016-04-01	We owe China billions, and Trump wants to risk and economic war with them. Am I th only one who sees a problem here?
2016-04-01	There are others, but you are wrong in your opinion. China has no effective way to use the loans - they aren't callable, and if China sells them, the dollar declines and makes US manufacturing more competitive against the Chinese manufacturing sector, all to the betterment of the US.
2016-04-01	Draenar Dubrovna -- Where are the factories for these US manufacturing jobs? How many years will it take to build them and bring them on line? We are no longer a manufacturing based economy but some people just can't figure it out.
2016-04-01	Alan Boorstein: I think you are wrong sir. This country could build plants here; train workers; and pay a livable wage, in a reasonable amount of time. Just because blue collar jobs have seemingly disappeared; doesn't mean the citizens whom would benefit from them have.
2016-04-01	“She saw what a warm, caring, thoughtful determined person she was,"??? PULEAZZZE!
2016-04-01	Vince Foster's type-written suicide note was just full of glowing statements about the Clintons...and very little else, interestingly....Vince basically said 'the Clintons are such awesome, innocent and wonderful people...the world will never know how innocent they are...so, now I've got to kill myself.'

2016-04-01	actually it was not illegal. When did you meet Hillary to make that determination? Did you spend an hour with her and just knew?
2016-04-01	Sherry Bural Honey, we've been exposed to Hillary for far too long. We know EXACTLY who or what she is.

Not only was Petraeus policy successful but she blew it all and still lies about it. She turned wine into vinegar. And how much disbelief are the American people supposed to engourge upon so that what she says will be deembed to be true?|

Get back to your knitting and keep your appoinements with your psychiatrist. And if you have to hate, and apparently you do, try thought first. And stop with that worn out cliche, "oh wait", it speaks of a tiny mind and limited imagination.

2016-04-01	Hillary Assad Another Idiot blaming Hillary for Iraq when it was GW Bush's war not Hillary's. Hillary voted to allow Bush to take action if need be but Hillary had no power to order anybody into Iraq. Better learn how government works and not make stupid posts like yours.

2016-04-01	Christian genocide, ISIS, Russia, 19 trillion in debt, brink of another recession, the Iran deal, Syria.. I could spend all day proving you wrong, but then again you are a useful idiot..
2016-04-01	Have you paid your health insurance premium lately. Have you seen your co-pays how about your deductible. Everything Obama touches turns to crap.......Obama the best gun saleman in the history of the USA...more guns on the streets in history thanks to Obma.
2016-04-01	Mike Austin - You are confusing the repairs of the Obama Administration with the breakage of the Bush Administration.
2016-04-01	I don't know if Trump understands foreign policy, but Obama has shown in action that he has no grasp of foreign policy.
2016-04-01	If you don't know if trump understands foreign policy or not, you have no credibility.
2016-04-01	Krzysztof Why don't you know? Trump has been telling you what he would do with foreign policy since he has been campaigning. He doesn’t have a clue. For candidate to be running for the high office in America, and this candidate he gets his wisdom for governing from TV/radio political shows, exactly does that mean to you? And what's your plan for fixing the Middle East that has been at war with each other forever? Trump has thrived on low information voters (LIV’s), are you one of them? Because your comment sounds like you’re a supporter. It’s ok if you are…….good luck

It went from women should be punished to I miss poked to now the abortion laws should stay where they are until I become President. With Lewandowski it was he did not touch that women. Then it was she made it up. Then it was she lied and over exaggerated what happened and now he is no where to be seen. Truly this is different from penis size, peeing in one's pants to whose wife is sleazier. Amazing.

2016-04-02	Jesse Cooday No need to be cryptic. The Clinton Campaign is a very data driven organization. They've known for some time, that despite Sander's recent wins, the path to the nomination is all but impossible. Knowing this, resources are allocated to most effectively to accomplish their goals, 1. Make their best effort to secure the WH for the Democratic Party. 2. Help elect other Democrats to House and Senate seats. It's called working toward actual progressive change. To accomplish this, they have to grit their teeth, and take it on the chin in places like Washington, Hawaii, and Alaska. They have to ease up on their attacks on Sanders, to work towards rallying support for the general. On the flip side, the Sanders campaign, must go for broke. Spend hard to attempt a Hail Mary in places like NY, and California, refuse to help in the down ballot races, and attack Clinton.
2016-04-02	Jesse Cooday You are absolutely right!
2016-04-02	The age distribution of support for Bernie v. Hillary is fascinating. Her edge is that older voters actually turnout consistently, but otherwise, I would be very concerned if I was her. It seems to forebode some real changes in the party.
2016-04-02	The Democratic Party needs the change - it is time to give up "GOP-Lite" - it would be good if Bernie would stop telling the young people that he has a magic wand and will be able to deliver free college and single payer health care (which, based on my newly acquired Medicare, is not great anyway). Hillary will be an excellent President.

2016-04-02	There are other numers to watch. Hillary and Bill Clinton’s close relations with Wall Street helped brought to financial bubbles (1999-2000 and 2005-8) and the Great Recession that followed Lehman’s collapse. In the 1990s they pushed financial deregulation for their campaign backers that in turn let loose the worst demons of financial manipulation, toxic assets, financial fraud, and eventually collapse. In the process they won elections and got mighty rich. Why no one is talking about this?

This issue is more important than any issue in this election cycle. Voter ID,affirmative action, reproductive rights, unions, LGBT rights.

if not this guy would never admit to anything.|

Please conservatively speaking how much more should be added to our debt after the Great Depression of 2008, considering the fact that we amass $11 trillion without any depression? So how much more has Obama added over your estimate and adding the war debt that Bush left him? Oh Obama should have reduced the debt even after the greatest depression since the 2nd world war ended, a country that inccured a debt of $11 trillion in good times, please what would a conservative do that would have been different to Obama's action considering you created the problem in the first place?

Anyone shocked ? Sheeee-iiit. THIS is why we need Donald Trump - to "once and for all" destroy the D.C. parties that despise the American middle class - in the (R) and the (D) party both. Both doing their very best to keep their gravytrain of lobbyists and politician puppets in place to destroy America as a sovereign free nation.

As long as the (D) & (R) party create and foster strife and confusion they succeed in slowly snuffing the lantern of Lady Liberty with feckless and UN centric leaders and debilitating, freedom eroding treaties.|

Want to help out the campaign but don't have time to head to an event? That's okay! Bernie need EVERYONE'S help with phonebanking. Phonebanking is a very easy thing to do, and it's very important to the campaign too. Phonebanking is when everyday Bernie supporters, like you, call undecided voters and/or other Bernie supporters to remind them about upcoming primary dates, and to see whether they're voting for Bernie or need help with voting.

2016-04-03	Debbie Wasserman-Schultz is at the top of that list, and she better be. Seeing how she and the DNC have practically given the nomination to HilIary wrapped in a bow, she should be the poster child for the long line of corrupt brown-nosers at Queen HilIary's back door. Also that seat in congress she has so thoroughly defecated upon will no longer suffer her. Timothy Canova for Congress!
2016-04-03	Pretty sure it's the voters
2016-04-03	Sanders is not now and never has been a Democrat and now he wants all of their advantages. Carpetbagger.
2016-04-03	Mike Martin LOL, you replied to an add. Another informed Shillary voter.
2016-04-03	|So when will The Lincoln Bedroom be back up for grabs?
Didn't Obama try to make policy that lobbyist couldn't get hired in govt within a certain period of time (eliminating the revolving door?)?
Didn't he then get rid of that sound policy in 2014 because it ended up being too hard and cumbersome for libs to abide by?
Don't you love it when politicians pretend to be bothered by money and influence in DC?|
2016-04-03	Tammy McKinnon cut the hypocrisy. Considering the revolving doors awaiting lobbyists, it's hard for any president to completely foreswear lobbyists in their administration. At least Obama tried, and he greatly reduced that practice. For Republicans it's practically a job requirement to have been or plan to be a lobbyist.
2016-04-03	Cheryl Onstad LOL he tried? Really? Are you that freaking dumb? While you are at it why don't you look up how he broke his own policy from day one...Start with Timothy Geithner...You people are either dumber than dirt (and that is what the politicians count on) or you really don't care about all of the crap you spout when election season rolls around.

Which is why the media has all but given up on the poor black people in Flint, but at least the Michael Moore's of the world cared for about 5 minutes until they figured out they coudn't bring down Snyder..

2016-04-03	|What does fair treatment mean in a party primary? That's not an easy question to answer.

To begin with, demanding the nomination if you have a pluarlity but not a majority of delegates on the 1st ballot is ASKING for unfair treatment in your favor. Trump has lobbied for that and that's completely out.

Beyond that, however, Trump may very well have grounds for complaint in the selection of delegates in states that he won. This could be true if those states conciously select anti-Trump delegates with an eye to dumping him on ballots after the 1st ballot.

I don't know enough about the normal processes used by states to select delegates to opine on this. But this is not an outrageous claim by Trump. For once he may have a leg to stand on here.|

Non-governmental organizations NEVER aspire to reach government power. That goal happens to be THE only one pursued by political parties. Your post is excellent, but you need to re-think two critical definitions: "private organization" and "NGO".

NGOs try to get support from the UN, for example. I doubt that the DNC and RNC will ever do that.

The 'story' hasnt changed in a year. So, dont worry that it's 'old news'. Why a story from a year ago? Because the TPP issue has been buried for a year and is just now, with the coming of the lame duck session, re-appearing and the pro-TPP propaganda splattering our screens, cable and newspapers.
The establishments recognize there is a great deal of anti-TPP sentiment and for good reason. Therefore, the politicians' objective is to pass it after the election is safely behind them and citizens' voices no longer matter (at least for another two-plus years).
Again, the 'story' hasnt changed in a year. So, dont worry that it's 'old news'. It is about to re-surface in the lame duck session.

Similarly, TPP would allow foreign investors to bring direct legal challenges against a wide range of host state regulations. In other words, US law and US courts would not determine America's future.
America's future would be determined by TPPs "international dispute resolution panel".

In the case of the Keystone Pipleline, the owners are suing the USA (you and me) for an amount of profits they projected from the pipeline.
AND
Over a third of these suits end in settlement BUT only after attorneys have had a field day spending our tax money OR WORSE we end up paying for Keystone's alledgedly lost profits.

Meanwhile the GOP has painted itself into a corner by pandering to, exploiting and fomenting the racism and bigotry of its base, since the very demographic shifts that freak them out also ensure that the "Southern Strategy" doesn't work anymore. But there was nothing to stop a bloated blowhard like Trump from swooping in and taking the game over from them, and playing it better than they ever could, precisely because he doesn't HAVE to care what happens to the GOP. So he can wreck it by making the base show its true colors more boldly than they ever have, thereby turning off the rest of America to that whole Klan rally.

2016-04-04	Mary Limon Balbuena — What a steaming crock ...
2016-04-04	They are equally repellent...
2016-04-04	It is Dondald Trump who is losing the nomination, not Ted Cruz who is winning this nomination. Trump never invested in the orgaization necessary to win the actual delegates and is now in grave danger of losing the nomination on the second ballot. Trump in this last two weeks have opened his mouth and terrified Repubican voters and even independents. Two weeks ago Trump was a sympathetic figure when a Super Pac supporting Cruz published a nude photo of Trump's wife. Everybody was on Cruz's back over it. The benefit of winning Idaho by over 50% and getting all the delegeates was over ruled by th...See More
2016-04-04	Cruz will never get the support of Trump supporters...We see this stealing of delegates as underhanded...
2016-04-04	If Cruz is nominated, he will never get the Latino support. He is a lair and a dangerous bible believer. He scares many people. He is despicable .
2016-04-04	Congratulations. You have taken media bytes, convoluted them into a spiral, and successfully hung your credibility with it.
2016-04-04	Faced with the choice of hateful Cruz or lunatic Trump, it's quite possible that the people of ND will just down a quart of vodka and crawl back into bed
2016-04-04	LOL and have sweet dreams of the days when we had a decent herd of candidates.
2016-04-04	If the issue is to get delegates in the GOP after the caucuses and primaries have been concluded and the winners announced, there is only one conclusion that can be made. That the GOP caucuses and primaries are a big waste of time, and money. For example, Donald Trump wins Lousiana, however Ted Cruz walks away from the State the actual winner because he was able to convince more delegates to support him than the Trumpster. Yep makes sense.
2016-04-04	I'm confused, isn't Trump going to make the best deals, deals like you've never seen? If he can't make favorable deals with the GOP - in a situation where all the rules of engagement are a simple matter of public record - how is he going to handle Putin? Iran? After destroying America by ceding American interests to Russia, will he whine that Putin was unfair? Or the argument he used last week about the wife drama... "not my fault, they started it!"
2016-04-04	Fairy Pardiwalla Trump is the master at deals but he doesn't have funding or the backing of the establishment Gop folks..
2016-04-04	Fairy Pardiwalla..."All the rules" have yet to be determined.
2016-04-04	To understand this convention and delegate war one has to go back to the 1952 Republican Convention which nominated Dwight David Eisnehower. At that convention Eisenhower and the Establishment went into the convention in a very tight battle with Robert A Taft, the firery Republican Senate Repubican Minority leader. Neither Taft nor Eisenhower had enough delegeates to garner the nomination. But the just like today, the Eisenhower / Establishment forces in 52 controled the State Conventions and elected the actual delegeates to the National Convention. At the credential's committee fight over sea...See More
2016-04-04	That will be a hard sell, because over the last four decades Americans have gotten used to a voter-dominated presidential nomination process, and the idea that the person who comes in first in the primaries wins.

Kasich is staying in for one reason right now, PA. and NJ and NY. In those states you have more Establishment type Republicans less friendly to Ted Cruz. If I am right and their is a contested convention, Cruz, the Establishment, Rubio and Kasich all have cut the deal to give Cruz the nomination. My bet is Kasich w...See More|

Trump can boast all that he wants but the fact is he can't get 50% of the vote from the GOP which doesn't even make up for half the electorate. Yeah, he got 49% of the GOP in the Massachusetts Primary, but that was only 17% of the votes cast.|

Remember this:
Ryan doesn't want to be speaker
01/23/14
SAN ANTONIO — Rep. Paul Ryan said he does not want to be speaker of the House, a declaration that will cause reverberations in Republican leadership circles in Washington. During a wide-ranging luncheon in a hotel ballroom here Thursday, Texas Tribune editor-in-chief Evan Smith asked: “Does Paul Ryan want to be speaker?”
Story Continued Below

“No, he doesn’t,” Ryan replied.

2016-04-04	So what? Ryan stepped forward when the party needed him to. Whether you support the Republican party or not, that's the kind of leadership you should be looking for. I believe he honestly did not want the speakership, but, did what was asked of him. The party is better off for it.
2016-04-04	Michael Rehkamp wow. You are either gullible or naive. Or both.
2016-04-04	|Michael Rehkamp so you are admitting the horrorshow that your Party has become, where you are basically going to drag a piece of work like Paulie Ryan into the race kicking and screaming whether he wants to or not " For the good of the Party" ?
I fully understand. if Trump was looking like he was going to be MY candidate, i would be doing the same thing.|
2016-04-04	I agree with his thought, if you want to be president then run from start to finish. No one else should be considered other then Trump, Cruz or kiaish. Also, if it's impossible to win you should be booted out if you refuse to leave. The delegates than are divided equally.
2016-04-04	Hope it Kasich or Cruz.

2016-04-04	He'd be a decent candidate; I do think given a wide variety of factors, to strain toward it, or to calculate your way into winning it at this late juncture would be distasteful. That said, if there were to be a natural deadlock in the convention process, he's a possibility. You have to really ask yourself whether it's acceptable to postulate a candidate who ran not at all, when three of them are going to go into the convention with some delegates. But, we'll see. I think some of this is insider wish-fulfillment. Best case scenario for a Ryan nom: there is a consensus among deadlocked delegates that the primary process didn't work this round, and that the state of the party is somehow in the balance, and that the resulting choices are simply not competative in November. That's a narrow band, but it isn't impossible.

That denigrates the taxpayer expense and votes of millions of people. Moreover, saying Ryan is the least "establishment" is demonstrably false - he has never had a real job. He graduated from college, went to work on the Hill as a staffer and then ran for Congress. He's been there ever since. He grew up on the teat of Mother Congress and the establishment. What's the point of saying something that is just a lie? This dishonesty is precisely what has gotten people so mad about Hillary Clinton on the left and the republican establishment on the right.

2016-04-04	|Here is the difference between a Sander's rally and Trump rally, and its clear why the two shouldn't be near each other:

http://www.vibe.com/.../free-hugs-project-at-donald.../

At a Trump rally, if you aren't brainwashed to give your first born as a sacrifice towards the Trump altar, you will get threatened with a "punch in the face". Also, don't try to hug anyone. The world is a bitter, evil place, where love is dead. No hugs allowed. Only hate and fear please.

At a Sanders rally, if you where a shirt that says "free hugs", you will get lots of free hugs, and even find other people who are wearing a similiar shirt. People are happy and optimistic about the future, and no one gets threatened with violence for not being a Sanders fan. (Although you will have your opinions questioned, so be prepared to back up your opinions with logic if you can.)|
2016-04-04	|Paul Estrada

The difference is that Bernie supporters aren't violent. The violence is from Trump supporters, since ignorant people tend to speak with their fists because their intellect can't keep up.

Every violent incident in this election was a Trump supporter being violent. Not a Bernie supporter. Not a Cruz supporter. Not a Rubio supporter. Not a Hillary supporter.

I doubt you can find even one video of a Bernie supporter throwing a punch, but I can easily find 10 videos of Trump supporters being violent.

Actually, here are 12 examples of violent Trump supporters:
http://www.slate.com/.../a_list_of_violent_incidents_at...|
2016-04-04	Actually Tim, I think the Sanders rally was going to be downwind from th trump rally so they couldn't take a chance on having thousands of people at the Sanders rally projectile-vomiting from the smell of body odor being emitted from the Trump hootenanny.
2016-04-04	|Paul Estrada

Your video assumes that everyone who hates Trump, must be a Bernie supporter.

Most of the country hates Trump, so why isn't Bernie currently winning in a landslide?

Derp.|
2016-04-04	Smart. I would worry about the safety of people attending the event if there were Trump people close by given the events of Trump rallys. I don't regard this as a time or place that a stand needs to be made against Trump, so it is just better to be separate and peaceful.
2016-04-04	Wise given the kinds of people Trump attracts. They come to do more than just listen.
2016-04-04	|Trump is no idiot. He surely understood what Forbes is saying a week ago. He surely knew that it was time to calm down in order to attract the additional delegates that would put him over the top.

But still, Trump went out there last week and incinerated. What does this say? It says that Trump doesn't have the self control needed to sew up the nomination.

When his campaign manager was charged, he couldn't control his ridiculous outbursts. The reporter might have had a bomb in her pen?

Then there's Trump's 2nd favorite activity (after vulgar tweets): Shooting from the hip. Trump stepped in it at least 4 times last week by speaking without thinking: Twice on abortion, once on the Geneva Convention and once on nuclear proliferation.

Face it Trump supporters: Your man doesn't have the self control needed to expand his support and to win the nomination.|
2016-04-04	Trump is NOT a seasoned politician who has dealt with issues in depth. This lack of experience does not bother me, it will come with the 'office'. He is also thin skinned, that will be the downfall of his candidacy.
2016-04-04	|Yogesh Gupta

You have no problem, YG, with a new President who doesn't know a thing about any important national policy issue?

Heck, I'd say that Trump's lack of interest in learning is almost more of a problem than the lack of knowledge itself. Example: With the possible exception of immigration, there is no hotter issue in the GOP than abortion. And 9 months into the campaign, Trump has thought so little of that issue that he can't avoid last week's off the cuff land mines? That shows serious lack of commmittment to learning issues.

I can't agree YG: I don't see Trump learning quickly in office. He's not interested in learning policy.|
2016-04-04	|David Kent
Do you apply this same thought to Obama, whose grasp of foreign policy is negligible? Or HIllary? Who is inept? Memorizing capitols and the names of leaders is swell, but it gets you only to break-even. Insight and vision are harder.
I think none of these three people have what it takes.|
2016-04-04	So I guess if Trump gets the delegates to win the nomination, Forbes will support him as well. Truly this says more about Forbes supporting a racist, bigoted, anti-semiite than it does about Donald Trump.
2016-04-04	He didn't say that.
2016-04-04	Mark Keeler the point I am making is that leadership should have disavowed Trump's candidacy a long time ago. Forbes represents a part of that leadership of the GOP and all he says is "if you do not tone it down you will loose the nomination"? What more can Donald Trump say. He is already damaged goods going into the national elections. So I guess the truth about women being punished for abortion as the position of the anti abortionist movement was too much but yet when Donald Trump stated that all Muslims would not be allowed into the US was not outrageous and acceptable? Even the GOP leadership does not know whether it is coming or going.
2016-04-04	|"a racist, bigoted, anti-semiite"

Have you ever actually thought about your position or do you just regurgitate the headlines you read?

Trump is so likeable he got the crowd at AIPAC on his side and they had to release an official statement saying they don't support him because it looked like the crowd did by the end of his talk. Liberalism has soundly rejected reality in the name of identity politics.|
2016-04-04	Forbes is missing the point that his key message is about bigotry and racism couched in economic and national security terms. How you tone down that hateful message to get a majority of Americans to vote for you is beyond my comprehension. Its his message that's the problem not the strategy.
2016-04-04	I would suggest that hateful as his message is, it is not the real problem. The real problem is the millions of American voters who actually believe he is something he is not, or can do things that cannot happen, and who will do whatever it takes to prove their/his point: lies, violence, internet trolling...

his ignorance. How can anyone accept that as a sign of
anything but intellectual laziness? He is selling ignorance as a rationalization for his lack of expertise in all areas.
This guy is a world class charlatan and the Republican underclass buys into his
justification of ignorance. It is abasurd to accept his contention that he will correct all of the world's
problems which have been created by the experts who have failed. Only fools could buy into what this guy is selling.|

2016-04-04	|Amazing how you could be so braindead as to think that Paul Ryan, a classic Tea Party favorite, is a RINO.
But then again, any supporter of Donald Trump either isn't a real conservative, or lacks any basic understanding of any of the issues at hand....|
2016-04-04	Arthur Dent - well yes. He still has a lot of Tea Party in him, but he's become very RINO in his handling of his current job thusfar.
2016-04-04	LOL....the GOP can't get out of its own way. They hate Trump, they hate Cruz, but are stuck with both of them...and only them.
2016-04-04	Yes and the dems are happy with an old anti wall street nut socialist and a soon to be inmate in the federal pen? Sure, yeah right.
2016-04-04	Carl Skornik Neither Trump nor Cruz can win the general election. Must be tough for you to accept. I take it you are pro-Wall Street? I'm voting for Bernie.
2016-04-04	Carl Skornik Very happy to vote for either. The GOP is doomed.
2016-04-04	It's a funny line to walk, because the notion is: Cruz has to be able to win the nomination coming in second place, but he's also recognized that he's probably not what the party means when it says they want to use the convention to nominate a "unity candidate."
2016-04-04	The only unity I can see in this case Chris is the GOP universally disliking cruz and holding their nose in their opposition to Trump
2016-04-04	Claire Smith Yeah, they're both making essentially an identical argument, but the logical outcome would be different in each case. I think the potentially new piece of information if Cruz is playing this game is: he's identified that the party is probably just using him to prevent Trump from winning on the first ballot, but not firmly committed to installing him on the second ballot, or at least he's trying to close that possibility by making it unreasonable. It's been a funny month, because everybody is agreed on creating the contested convention, but there aren't any clear theories on what should happen from there; there isn't this firm and unequivocal "so we can nominate Ted," it's substantially less defined than that. If there is a plan, it's not yet appropriate to say out loud.
2016-04-04	Cruz is correct: the Republican party is toast.

2016-04-04	|Donald Stern I'd love to know what you think that actually means. Nothing made overseas in our shops? No trade with other countries? Start a war in the Middle East? Build a $35 billion dollar wall between the US and Mexico which will only keep Americans in, not Mexicans out?

Trump is a TV-made figurehead. He has no policies and no idea how to implement them even if he had some. His speeches are cliches and insults, nothing more. Is that 'great' to you?|
2016-04-04	Donald Stern, the media and Koch Brothers and Mitch McConnell are doing their best to stop Trump. Stamp out McConnell and Koch Brothers now.
2016-04-04	Well if Trump gets the majority of the votes how can Cruz think he should win. Cruz wants to just change the rules or to make him nominee. As a republician I woulld never vote for Cruz. He is fooling the people convincing them how he is so prepared. Bull he just has a big ego. Yes Trump has a big ego but he has a lot to show for it. Cruz has nothing to show. He is trying to convince people all he did in the senate. He did nothing except trying to shut the goverment down. He needs to work with people and he can't. If you listen to Cruz now he is campaigning on stateme nts Rubio and Trump said in gthe last few months. He is using other canditates statements to make himself look good.
2016-04-04	|Scot, pull out the rule book ( off the internet) and read the actual words. If not a majority, you have to hit the magic number of 1237. Period.

And I agree with that AS THEN THE GOP IS PLAYING BY THE RULES THAT THEY SET... 1237.|
2016-04-04	Cathy Williams But how can you give it to the person that comes in second. Cruz's own words to Rubio coming in second doesn't make you a winner.
2016-04-04	|Scot Lori Colt Again, READ THE RULES. It all comes down to how the delegates are apportioned, and how they become unbound with each progressive ballot at the convention. And because Cruz has a good ground game and Trump's campaign is inept, many, if not most, of the Trump-bound delegates are Cruz supporters. That means that when they become unbound in the second and third ballots, they will change their vote from Trump to Cruz.
Again, IT'S THE RULES. IT'S HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS. But I guess when all you listen to is whining, stupid, loser Trump who doesn't accept that he is losing, you can't comprehend that there is a way that Trump lost that was actually fair and square. It was literally all there for him to do as well, and he was just too stupid or inept to capitalize on it.|

2016-04-04	Kasich gives me the runs.
2016-04-04	If the RNC rule of minimum 8 primary states wins is valid, Kasich should get out, since he can not reach this treshold. Trum won 212, Cruz won 9, so they are in. Kasich won one (1) and should continue running only if he honestly believs that he can win additional 7 in the coming primaries.
2016-04-04	The 8 state rule was only put in place to keep Ron Paul (Independent) off the ballot at an RNC event. Every convention's rules are set specific to it's individual needs, by delegates and a commitee therein.

The Sanders campaign is exaggerating the contributions that Clinton has received from the oil and gas industry. In the context of her overall campaign, the contributions are hardly significant. It’s especially misleading to count all of the funds raised by lobbyists with multiple clients as money “given” by the fossil-fuel industry.
Three Pinocchios|
2016-04-04	As long as you don't consider Hillary Clintons Super Pac as part of her campaign that is valid. If you consider a Super Pac for Hillary Clintons campaign as part of her campaign then that is not valid.

2016-04-04	Hillary is a proven liar, Linda
2016-04-04	I guess this works if you can delude yourself into believing that people don't expect anything in return for going to the trouble of raising millions of dollars for a candidate.
2016-04-04	Vermont charges more than five times as much for community college than does California. Why hasn't Sanders been able to achieve a political revolution in his home state?
2016-04-04	If he was the governor your statement would be a good one to make but as a member of congress it makes no sense to put that on him

2016-04-04	just the fact that she WANTS money from war mongers, oil tygoons, banksters and CEO's tells you Hillary can't be trusted to put people the first. Check out her records for cripes sake!
2016-04-04	Where are BS tax returns?
2016-04-04	Same lobbyists represent renewal energy. Failing to admit that is being dishonest. It's cherrypicking data, which is sadly, something Team Sanders now regularly does.

Even if Hillary loses 50% of all states going forward, she will still win the pledged delate race (does not include super delegates)

Many have predicted that 20% of Bernie base will riot when Bernie loses nomination. They are the left's version of tea baggers, full of conspiratorial stories and have Bernie's tactic support for them to riot.

Hillary needs only 20% of Bernie youth voters and she will easily have over 70%. Meanwhile Bernie needs over 60% of Hillary’s voters (over 30 + minority). Over 50% are hardened voters and will not vote for socialist|
2016-04-04	|His wierdest mistake was to make his attempt to convert superdelegates so public. That's going to make them less likely to switch. That "strategy" is much moreintended to keep his supporters encouraged than any actual attempt to turn superdelegates. He'd have to pull into a 3 digit pledged delegate lead over HRC to even make the bulk of them think about it.

The "whoever won a state should get that state's supers" argumet is dumb too, and if he really believed it, he'd be pressuring Elizabeth Warren to endorse Hillary Clinton then.|

2016-04-04	Hank Marcus Like his mentor, AH...he will make Amerika Great Again.
2016-04-04	They shoulde draft Limbaugh and then all the dirty laundry on this drug abuser can come out.
2016-04-04	Hank Marcus I wish you would post this all over Twitter and Facebook Hank. You are seriously well informed and on the right team. We need to blast all social media and educate them that is the dumpsters about how bad a leader Donald Trump debate. He is a disaster waiting to happen... Hot headed blowhard selfish bragging narcissistic idiot
2016-04-04	As Sanders is finding out, money doesn't always guarantee campaign victories in America. He can outraise Hilary, but he's still going to lose the nomination.

This is Donald Trump's most shocking statement yet,

However the mainstream media isn't saying a word about it!

What are they really trying to cover up?
I'm sending this to all my friends, family and patriot brothers......See More|
2016-04-04	Eric Shepard and Bernie is blowing through a lot more money than Hillary is.
2016-04-04	Mario Galdamez But Sanders has more money.
2016-04-04	I agree Sanders is like a little fly he just won't go away
2016-04-04	|You're not voting for Sanders just because he is a white man?? That's crazyyyy. How about people just decide who the best candidate is based on policy??
If you compare Sanders' foreign policy record to Clinton's, it's pretty obvious who is the progenitor of worldwide white supremacy.|
2016-04-04	Seth Yeazel Sanders Policy ideas have been debunked for months, since his plans were made public, even the Democrats rolled their eyes at his lack of 4th grade math skills.
2016-04-04	Seth Yeazel Nowhere in his comment did he say that.
2016-04-04	Give Up, Oldie Commie! Your own Party doesn't want you.
2016-04-04	Trump fan, are you? It' s getting hard to tell the difference between Trump fans and Clinton fans when Sanders stands to win a primary.
2016-04-04	|OK - so if no Sanders supporters agree to support Hillary, You'll be OK? In late January, the number of Bernie supporters who said "Never Hillary" was 20%. Only six weeks later, that number rose to 35%. It appears to still be growing as more and more Bernie supporters are hooking up to discuss where their votes should go: Write in Jill Stein, Bernie Sanders, or skip the election.

Hillary can't win without Bernie supporters, and I for one have become a Never Hillary under ANY circumstances.|
2016-04-04	|Sander's $44 million to Clinton's $15 million grassroots.
One thing is clear, if the DNC is serious about the interests of the democratic party versus the interests of their appointed queen, it's time to jump ship.|
2016-04-04	Hmm lets see she's raises 15 million for them in this quarter alone compared to the 0 he's raised for them! This isn't hard at all let's go for the independent senator who doesn't give a single shit about down ticket elections.
2016-04-04	Tye Moore She didn't raise $15 million for them, she raised $15 million THROUGH them. The money goes to her PACs and such.
2016-04-04	|Seb Williams Wrong. Hillary has raised money on behald of other Democrats, helping them to get elected.

Bernie says 'we'll see'.|
2016-04-04	So she raised $35.7...compared to his $44 million.
2016-04-04	The $15 million through the Hillary Victory Fund can't go directly to her campaign -- that's illegal. It goes mostly to her PACs, and some to the DNC which is supporting her.
2016-04-04	Seb Williams The Hillary Victory Fund is a bribery scheme. It mostly funds the campaigns of her Democratic super delegates who have pledged themselves to her.
2016-04-04	Then why is the dumbass running for President?
2016-04-04	Hey dumbass, you elected a community-organizing racist POS who sat in a den of Anerica-hating racists for 20 years (Trinity United) and hung out with like-minded unrepentant domestic terrorists, you hypocritical imbecile :-)
2016-04-04	Michael Larrea lol...Have fun in that bubble....
2016-04-04	|Michael Larrea "Anerica-hating?"

Nice smiley face. Are you Kendall Jenner?|
2016-04-04	So if elected his goal is not to govern, it is just not to be boring. This guy defines being an idiot.
2016-04-04	That is NOT what he said. You are the idiot here.
2016-04-04	Joe Odegard...that is what he said....baa, baa.
2016-04-04	Joe Odegard A person can not choose one day to be presidential and the next not to be, or one moment to be and the next not to be. It is not an act, it is not some kind of silly play, either you ARE presidential or you are not. And trust me....TRUMP IS NOT.

2016-04-04	Elizabeth Pengson Hillary's excuses were pathetic at best. It is blatantly obvious that she is hiding something. You're delusional if you actually believe that Bernie has some kind of black stain on his taxes. Furthermore, he has a proven track record of transparency- he has nothing to hide.
2016-04-04	That new voter ID law is going to be a problem
2016-04-04	get an id.....no problem
2016-04-04	Wisconsin annouced last Friday that they had record early voting so that may dappen Bernie's advantage at having an open primary.
2016-04-04	FOR WHO THE ILLEGAL ALIEN WHY SHOULD THEY VOTE AND IF YOU CAN'T ASSIMULATE THAN SHOULD THEY VOTE
2016-04-04	Problem is ind voters may choose largely to vote in the GOP primary to stop Trump, its an unknown.....
2016-04-04	No the worry there is Hillary voters doing that...like they did in Michigan allowing Sanders to take the state.
2016-04-04	Brandon Johns did you see what the net delegate difference was in Bernie's "big win" in Michigan?
2016-04-04	Good point.:(

2016-04-04	He also desparately needs a pleasant dispostion.
2016-04-04	Mike Martin A requirement for your presidential nominee? Bernie is the only one with a real smile and an honest laugh. But there is nothing pleasant about any of them on a debate stage, so guess you are out of luck!
2016-04-04	Sick of that C**t scum bag supporters. She will say it isn't a state because there aren't any black folks.
2016-04-04	Brenda Gertsch. You're only telling us what kind of person YOU are.
2016-04-04	Racist much? Seems the Sanders people only respect diversity when they support their ideas.
2016-04-04	Stop.
2016-04-04	Makes sense to me. I work for a Fortune 50 (not 500) company, and we have pay zones based on the local market. Some places are simply more expensive to live than others. $15 an hour in New York is different than in South Carolina.
2016-04-04	Agreed. Let's get a $15 national floor, then places like NYC, parts of CA, etc. can raise theirs even higher.
2016-04-04	Brian Cairns Why not make it $500 an hour? Then everyone can be millionaires!
2016-04-04	Exactly. I've been saying that the entire time. Cost of living and location must be taken into consideration. Making it $15 in poor areas may hurt small businesses. $12 would make more sense. Not to mention that the GOP has refused to even consider $10.10. Clinton is 100% correct in her thinking. She could probably get $12 pushed through ($15 has zero chance of passing with a GOP majority in congress), then leave it up to states/counties decide if they want to raise it to $15.
2016-04-04	How much money did the Clinton Foundation promise Cuomo the governor?
2016-04-04	Do you have proof to back up that statement? No, then you got nothing! Suck it up buttercup!
2016-04-04	if he really wanted to, Cumo can buy out clintons -- that's the reality
2016-04-04	Another baseless accusation. How original.
2016-04-04	Sanders drags Clinton into wage wars????? I've been reading about Hillary forgetting about hiding her money from her doners into her private charity for the past few years...now it's become an isue and Sanders is the bad guy ....Only in America
2016-04-04	Yet there is no proof to any of what you just stated! Just your opinion and you know what they say about those!

2016-04-04	you have no right to see them
2016-04-04	Geo Gonzalez Bernie portrays himself as being on the higher moral ground, but his lack of transparency seems hypocritical, I'm tired of him being given a pass because everyone assumes he's honest, I think he should put up or shut up.
2016-04-04	Why try to recycle Dumbo?
2016-04-04	What second act. His standing in the polls in Wisconsin is at 37 percent. John Doe has just raised its ugly head again giving 3 prosecutors standing to appeal the decision to kill John Doe by the Wisconsin Supreme Court to the US Supreme Court based upon conflict of interest and the failure to recuse oneself.

2016-04-04	Really? Do you have any compelling reason to think so or you jus feel that way? I am black and I have no reason not to like him. I will be voting for him.
2016-04-04	Abdulai Bah He's not racist, but he was willing to sellout to republicans. He was negotiating a deal to cut Social Security (remember the Simpson-Bowles report). Also, as a black person, why do you think that it is that blacks make up 25% of the democratic party, but only 2% of the democratic senators, and 0% of democratic governors? Obviously race plays a largely negative role for black candidates, and there's nothing wrong if black people decide to vote against that kind of exclusion.

However the Governor is white, the 2 Senators are white, the Attorney General is white, the State Comptroller is white, the leader of the Maryland Senate is white, and the leader of the Maryland House is white. And all of those positions are filled by white males except for the senate seat in question here which is filled by a white woman. And who have white democrats decided is best qualified to succeed her, yet another white male. White males are only 25% of Maryland, but if CVH wins, they’ll totally ...See More
2016-04-04	|So point to one thing all these white people have done or passed that hurts the black minorities in the state. It is one thing to question equal representation but to question the character of these people with no evidence is childish.

Would you like me to call you racist because you are saying these things? I guess your point would be better made that white men in Maryland have better access to money so they can advertise more then a minority counter part.

The examples you use make it sound like Maryland is some aparteid state where black people rights are all stripped and they are kept down. It sound sort of crazy when you take what you said in a historical context.

This race thing has been and continues to be very silly.|
2016-04-04	These Clinton votes counts are meaningless. It doesn't include anybody who votes in caucuses, most of which went massively for Obama (just as they're going massively for Bernie now). In the case of 2008 that also includes Michigan and Florida, where Obama wasn't even on the ballot... in short, 33 contests to 23. Yeah, no, she didn't win in any sense.
2016-04-04	Representation is fine, quotas are a disaster. Voting for her because of her skin color is just as racist as voting against her because of her skin color. She is asking for black racism.
2016-04-04	yeah yeah, vote for me cause i am black blah blah blah
2016-04-04	As opposed to "don't vote for her because she's black". That worked really well for Republicans in the past two presidential elections.

2016-04-05	Make America Great Again 2016
2016-04-05	Glad to see this bloodied, badly beaten up lady is recovering from the broken bones, bruises, and conussion from hitting the floor! Surprised to see she is able to walk and talk!
2016-04-05	Yeah, that's not even the point. The point is, Lewandowski clearly grabbed her by the arm and forceably moved her from her path; then Trump and his campaign trashed her and continue to trash her, all while lying through their teeth. Was Lewandowski meaning to hurt Fields? Doubtful. But fact of the matter is, she was walking nearly stride in stride next to Trump, in front of a Secret Service agent and he didn't remove her. That's his job, not Lewandowski's. Donald's assertion that she "grabbed" him has also been disproved with photos of Fields tapping his wrist with the back of her hand, in all honesty it looked like he may not have felt it, it was that light.
2016-04-05	Phil Lisi, this twit will milk (no sexist insinuation intended- lol) this for all it's worth!! Next up, she'll claim rape!!
2016-04-05	Like most serial abusers, you don't bloody up the women you beat, right? You just punch them in the gut and tell them to say "they fell" when the bruises are shown. If there's no blood, then you didn't really hurt them right?
2016-04-05	I've watched the video a dozen times. Hard to see where anything as severe as she is claiming took place. I think her pride was hurt more then her body.
2016-04-05	|She was clearly grabbed by Lewandowski. Did she nearly fall, perhaps, but the video (as is the nature of security cameras) cut out a bit. Either way, it doesn't matter. Trump and his campaign have spent weeks trying to shut Fields up, and the simple battery charge only added gas to the fire. You Trump supporters are so blind and sensitive to even the smallest bit of negative coverage, which ironically is showing who the real Trump is, and by continuing to support him, it shows who his supporters are, though it wasn't difficult to tell.

The time for Trump's Train to come to a screeching halt has come.|

2016-04-05	Rove reminds me of the football commentators on Sunday's. The ones who love to say things like, " if they just move the ball down the field and score some touchdowns, they could win this game." Takes up air space, but doesn't really say anything.

2016-04-05	“It comes down to numbers. And in the final days of this presidential race, from polling data to early voting, they favor Mitt Romney,” Rove wrote in a WSJ op-ed ignoring the fact that most polls showed growing momentum for the president. He predicted that Romney will win 51 percent of the popular vote and “at least 279 electoral votes.” Hey Karl, here's a couple numbers for you to analyze, 47.2, and 206. Whoops.

2016-04-05	No matter what happens, this summer is going to be wild politically. We may see the Republicans try to block Trump from becoming the nominee, and we may see Clinton referred to Justice for indictment.
2016-04-05	Referred for indictment even though he just said it probably wouldnt be wrapped up. And that is just the prob, more like fall or not at all.
2016-04-05	Douglas Ford - Don't you think if the FBI had something they would have put it out by now. What they're doing is trying their damndest to find something, anything they can hang on Hillary. Chuck Grassley in the senate and his ilk are pushing their allies in the FBI to submit an indicment to the JD.
2016-04-05	Beverly Ann Howard : I also think that after winning the Presidency, Hillary Clinton would be handcuffed before placing her hand on the Official Bible and perp-walked to prison. This is what the followers of Mitch McConnell want to have happen. They would DESTROY our Constitution happily. What they would replace it with, only Donald J. Trump knows.
2016-04-05	For those who expect an inditement, they will be sorely disappointed. But asa Trump leaves the GOP to mount an independent campaign. their disappointments will be many
2016-04-05	oh i guess you're an fbi investigator? some kind of political analyst? thanks for the insider tip :p
2016-04-05	Dima Braun No, its called an OPINION. You're free to disagree. I personally do not think anything will come out of it.
2016-04-05	John, it is spelled indictment...don't scratch you're head and wonder why your self employed.
2016-04-05	Looks like Comey got his marching orders from Obama's Attorney General, Lapdog Lynch, to slow walk the investigation so as not to interefere with Carpetbagger Clinton's Coronation.
2016-04-05	Always a conspiracy theory when you don't get your way.
2016-04-05	Cheryl Onstad What would you be saying if Comey announced he was in no hurry to complete an investigation of Ted Cruz for malfeasance in office?
2016-04-05	Cheryl Onstad How is two FBI investigations a theory?
2016-04-05	As a clinton supporter this troubles me, if she is indicted of any wrong doings or misconduct by the FBI i will not support her anymore. I will rather, vote for senator sanders or whoever the democratic nominee is so we can win the whitehouse back and get two or three liberal supreme court nominess which i think is the most important election issue this cycle, the supreme court i mean. No candidate is bigger than a party.
2016-04-05	the fact that she's being investigated isn't enough? it's already known that her conduct was at worst negligence and in reality a federal crime.. the question is will the justice department have the guts to actually prosecute?
2016-04-05	Dima Braun To me it is innocent until proven guilty. Period.
2016-04-05	Dima Braun It disturbs me more that some emails have been retroactively classified top secret.
2016-04-05	Seriously, I cannot stop laughing. Now that his carnival barking is coming to a close, I hope the media will finally concentrate on Crazy Cruz and his Dominionst views and sicko endorsements from "Christian" RWNJs.

2016-04-05	Yes, he'll protect them like he uses his Brown Shirts at rallies. What does all this protection get him, more protests and violence. So he'll escalate violence to protect them further which in turn will create more violence. Its an old solution from tyrants of the past and no real solution at all, but come on 'trust him. '
2016-04-05	Is this an April fools joke? Sanders is delusional
2016-04-05	#feelthebern
2016-04-05	actually Shaniqua, today is april 5th. so no, not april fools. today is the day bernie sanders wins wisconsin, and continues his streak of winning the majority of the remaining states
2016-04-05	Ramses Hoc hope you got that tattooed. #noregerts
2016-04-05	He's not winning NY. It's too late for these delusional 19 year olds to register there. Also, I guess all of the Black and Hispanic voters in NY have ceased to exist.
2016-04-05	What an EXCELLENT WAY to eventually unify the party, well done Haley! Definitely keep it up, it's not like there's a general election to worry about...a general election where we'll need the "delusional 19 year olds" to prevent Drumpf, or just as bad, Cruz, from being president. Not to mention the many millions of others, including myself, who are neither delusional NOR a teenager.
2016-04-05	|If the shoe fits wear it and yes at this point in the game there is a lot of delusional going around.

Also if you want demcorats to respect you stop attacking the party and the front runner with republicans talking points and not the whole truth on many things.

Bernie people start doing that you might get some respect until then you are acting as a hostile take over and will not be accepted as a democrat.

Basically maybe some of you should think about making your own party and see how it goes. trying to use the democrat party to go extreme left will not work nationwide in the primary.|
2016-04-05	Adam Rothstein Sorry, maybe I can insult minorities and women over 25 as you and your ilk have. Would that make you feel better?
2016-04-05	|Wait....so Sanders hated super delegates and accused the DNC of all types of stuff....but is now planning for a contested convention based on the will of the people? So far, more "people" have voted for Hillary.

I thought Bernie was a "good guy"...but I'm starting to see him as something different. It seems like his motivation has changed from "his message" to "him".

Anyway. I think he will easily take Wisconson and Wyoming. But lose NY by at least 10 points, and Maryland by 30.

Once NY goes, that pretty much ends it. He would have to bank on taking Cali by +30 points to get back in it.|
2016-04-05	Mark Hendricks...Hillary is way up in Pennsylvania too.
2016-04-05	mark hendricks - sanders has always been an a*hole and voters are just finding this out. not one of his colleagues in the senate has endorsed him. these are people who interact with him every day - so that should tell you something. sanders is a purist - there is notroom in his mind to compromise. the presidency is all about compromise - there is no black and white, Can anyone possibly see him on the world stage. He would be an absolute disgrace and laughingstock - an embarrasement for the U.S.
2016-04-05	Kelly Lacroix Bernie will also lose in WV and KY by large margins.
2016-04-05	Delusional old fool! He might take wisconsin by 1 or 2%, an it won't be enough to get him a head of her. Then NY is hers. And if he was by some mircle able to get NY, it wouldn't be by enough to do him any good. He'd have to take every state left by 49% to contest her lead. The further he falls behind, the more delusional this old man gets. He couldn't even remember Walders name the other days at the Rally, an called him Mr. Scott instead. Your can tell he's getting wore out an crankier by the day. He don't look so goood most days.
2016-04-05	NcCole - At this point, he is ego driven. After being ignored his whole life, he finally has an outlet for his meglomania and all those yuuuuuge rallies he's holding are feeding that ego. He doesn't want it to end. and anything he can do to hurt Hillary and the democratic party be damned. It's all about him and always has been and now we are finally seeing his true colors.
2016-04-05	Sanders needs 58% of the remaining delegates to just pull even with Hillary. Yes, he and his campaign are starting to show their true stripes.
2016-04-05	I noticed that. He only talked about it after Hillary publicized the issue. He's enthralled with himself like he's the ground-zero #BSBro or something.
2016-04-05	Foreign Policy, clear plans, 30 million dollars raised by HRC for down the ticket races... I will only vote for a Democrat not a parasite who used the party for fundraising and Press... Let Bernie take his Brand back to Vermont... Contesting the Democratic convention is a final insult. he has eshewed the Democratic party at every turn...
2016-04-05	Why do you need to be attached to a political party? They are both corrupt and hold dinners that cost $10k to attend. Even if you have views that match a party, being a zealot to them only serves to divide this country. No one is made better by having a D or R next to their name.
2016-04-05	Tony Adams He should've run as an independent if he felt that way.
2016-04-05	Robert Schrader - You are not familiar with the modern political system. It is almost impossible to get on all ballots as an idependent. American politics is rigged for the two party system.
2016-04-05	So a Dem might win Utah... Mizz and now Miss, if Trump is the Rep nom. Wow...
2016-04-05	Obama won 365 Electoral Votes in 2008, HRC might win 400 EV.
2016-04-05	Hillary Assad lmao so what would your preferred response to Gadafi using artillery shells against peaceful protesters??? and your response to Gadafis impending civilian massacre in libya? U know the UN security council signed off on that right?
2016-04-05	Hillary Assad -- LOL... That seems to be big plus in MS....
2016-04-05	If she's that close, Bernie would handily beat him there. Every person that voted for Hillary in the primary would vote for Bernie over Trump in the General Election. Difference is, Bernie would get a lot more independents and they are who determines the winner (in addition to an enthused base). If the polls don't reflect that for Bernie in Mississippi right now then that's just because they are still unfamiliar with Bernie Sanders. The Clintons strategy of keeping people in the dark about Bernie really paid off. They cut the number of debates down from 25 debates in 2008 versus Obama to only 5 debates this time around versus Bernie... That is until Bernie demanded 3 additional debates.
2016-04-05	Delusional.
2016-04-05	|Please tell us how Bernie can beat Hillary, in the primaries he's no match now you're telling us he will beat her in the general elections?
The reason Bernie beats Trump over Hillary is because he had never been vetted nationally , once you're the front runner it changes the game. Carson was better in the general elections but once he became the front runner he was vetted and dropped out.
Kasich is another one, anytime he becomes the front runner or the nominee he's vetting will start and he will be exposed.
Bernie has never been the front runner so nobody thinks he can win and he has never been vetted.|
2016-04-05	Yeaaahhh, clearly the person who is handily losing the Democratic nomination would do better than the person who is handily winning, because logic and facts right?
2016-04-05	It will be such a WIPEOUT if the Trumpdumb wins the nomination! Hillary w 400 EV. Thanks Donald! Please continue...
2016-04-05	Hey didja come up with dat gem, Trumpdumb, all by yourself? You sure is clever, and at least you capitalized his name, good boy.

2016-04-05	Jon Bond Have you noticed the names on all these scams. I know it sounds far fetched but I think it is meant to suck them in for isis to see who is recruitable.
2016-04-05	I was looking at some state level general election polls yesterday, and I was shocked how weak Donald Trump would be. He would lose Utah, North Carolina and some other traditionally Republican States. Cruz's map looks very traditionally Republican, while kasich will potentially win Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and possibly even NY
2016-04-05	|No.
That Cruz map does not reflect his lack of appeal to either moderates or women in a General Election, and Cruz looks like a dirtbag creep to most women. Both Trump and Cruz have a huge problem with them.

Obama beat Romney with Women by double digits, 55-44% I can't think either one is going to be more appealing to most women than fit, handsome, moderate, good father and husband Mitt Romney.|
2016-04-05	Ed Johnson Amen. I'd rather look at Trump for 4 years than Cruz.

"The reason why being pro choice is the right way to go is because it is a choice and hopefully a choice that is rooted in the thoughtfulness and the care that women bring to this decision. So of course you can be a feminist and be pro-life."

2016-04-05	She far more relevant than you will ever be. I guess that really hurts...

2016-04-05	Nice looking woman, making hay while the Trump shines. I frequently leave the TV on FoxNews after O'Reilly and am amazed she is so popular, given her habit of being unprepared for interviews. It is often obvious she knows little about the subject being discussed; and has featured a Trump hit piece on most of her shows since the first debate. Hopes "it will stop" ? Are you kidding?
2016-04-05	I agree 100%. Exactly my same feelings

2016-04-05	Going to get involved with Politics you should do a little research into the Candidate before posting, Hillary is sinking fast, And it has nothing to do with Opinion its the 40 years of Corruption that People are actually starting to look at.

2016-04-05	Pedar J Kristiansen if you're going to wade into politics you should probably know the very obvious demographic challenge Bernie faces here. Also, you fail to realize that Hillary has yet to be affected despite people saying her campaign is crumbling for over two months. She's still winning, she's still the frontrunner, and sanders will not sway the same superdelgates he railed against just a few months ago.

2016-04-05	Damn! DWS thought for sure she was going to get away with this one.
2016-04-05	It's a bit misleading to say, "because the city's Democratic Party submitted the paperwork for Sanders one day too late," because that is not the reason. They also submitted Clinton's paperwork late as well. Sanders was only taken off the ballot because a Clinton supporter filed a protest against Sanders being on the ballot due to the paperwork being late. The Democratic Party made a stupid mistake, but the real reason this is a story is because one of Clinton's supporters pulled such a cynical move about it.
2016-04-05	If Clinton's papers were late as well then why did we not hear about it , we only heard that Bernie wouldn't be on the ballot ? As far as that Clinton's supporter ,she really needs to stop the attacks and watch her tone :)
2016-04-05	Linda Rock We did hear about it, that's how I know about it. The question you should be asking is, as I pointed out, why didn't Politico mention it in this article?

2016-04-05	|Soon after taking office in 2009, Obama and his secretary of state — who is currently the Democratic presidential front-runner — began pushing for the passage of stalled free trade agreements (FTAs) with Panama, Colombia and South Korea that opponents said would make it more difficult to crack down on Panama’s very low income tax rate, banking secrecy laws and history of noncooperation with foreign partners.

2016-04-05	wait...didn't the superdelegates decide who won in 2008?
2016-04-05	no
2016-04-05	At the end Obama had a 100 delegate pledged delegate lead with 1,800+ to her 1,700+. Neither had the number needed for to clinch in pledged delegates. Super-delegates are what put him over the top. Clinton could essentially clinch as soon as she reaches 2,383 which may or may not come before CA, unlike Sanders she's not trying to rip the Democratic Party apart because she's losing.
2016-04-05	|Roy Carl YES they did as neither
Hillary or Obama had the full amount of Pledged Delegates
(Obama was ahead by 105 but
did not even have 2,000. Try
Researching the FACTS before

2016-04-05	She must have forgot 2008 but that's ok because I don't doubt Hillary won't have the 2383 needed come 6/14 at 7pm in DC.
2016-04-05	No, she didn't forget 08. Obama led in pledged delegates and he was the nominee. Pretty straightforward.
2016-04-05	|Good luck for Bernie because he needs 67% of the remaining Pledged delegates to get to the magic number. After running an "us against them" campaign if he wants to go to the convention depending on the "them" to get him accross the finish line he is in for a rude awakening.

Even if he won 67% and Hillary won 33% she would still hit the magic number as well.|
2016-04-05	President Hillary Clinton. Get used to saying it!
2016-04-05	How about we do away with delegates entirely, and just move to a one person, one vote system. Whoever has the majority wins the nomination. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the general wins the presidency. Anything else is absurd.
2016-04-05	Absurd is a bit strong. There are arguments for and against the electoral college. A very simple argument for it is that the majority of the country lives on the coasts. What if a presidential candidate promised to give tax breaks (or some other benefit) that only benefitted those living on the coasts? He could completely ignore 75% of the geographic area of the country and still win. You think that's a recipe for civil discourse? I see regional strife writ large. Saying anything other than a popular vote is absurd is oversimplifying a layered issue. The founders were not idiots, maybe consider their reasoning for a second before jettisoning it?
2016-04-05	Start your own party and you can set your own parties rules. As far as the general election it will only take a constitutional ammendment, good luck with that.

2016-04-05	Terry Doe I am at a bar in NYC toasting Hillary not Ted or "Donnie 2 Times.". The place is packed with her supporters. There's a few Bernie supporters talking trash yet there have been of fist fights. Image that. It's just like a Jets v. Giants game. We New Yorkers can disagree on candidates and then unite and support either of our teams when then make it to the Superbowl. By the way, there was one Trump supporter wearing high waters & red cap who was ID and escorted out to loud cheers. Apparently, his baby fingers gave him up.
2016-04-05	why is goldmaker lying by saying cruz is ahead in all of the last 6 polls?
2016-04-05	because he, like most of the media world, is VERY anti-Trump.
2016-04-05	Because it's the truth, but I forget that you trump supporters are not used to hearing the truth from your candidate. That's funny that the media is anti-trump, he only gets 75% more coverage than any other candidate. Again the truth doesn't matter to you idiots!!!

It is the weirdest thing ever--it's almost like he delivers his line and when it is met with applause, he's saying to himself, "They bought it!" and can't help having a little laugh in Hitlerian delight.
Do a shot every time Ted has a giggle...you won't last long.|
2016-04-05	Winston Herzog if you took a drink whenever Trump said something coherent, you'd be on the wagon permanently.
2016-04-05	"Pass the popcorn" why do liberals always say this? It's the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard on these boards. Can’t you just hear the snarky, self-righteous, holier-than-thou, smug tone in their assertion? Get a life you freaks. While I hope Hillary implodes with the FBI investigations I would never say “pass the popcorn” because not only is it lame and childish, it makes you look like a fool.
2016-04-05	Why is Cruz publicly saying he wants Kasich out? Kasich helps Cruz. He siphons off TRUMP voters.

2016-04-05	Urge all people to read Sanders interview with Daily News. For one whose entire campaign is about Wall street, his utter ignorance was astonishing. I honestly thought it was from the Onion.
2016-04-05	Sherry Bural I agree. Sanders had no clear answers and doesn't seem to understand what powers he would or would not have as president. The comment I found the most disturbing was how he would have a 'more agressive' justice department which would look for illegalities on Wall Street. That's scary. SOunded like if he couldn't find any law breaking he'd make it up.
2016-04-05	Cheryl Onstad ... i wonder how that interview will play in the new york primary since it is a new york paper which lots of new yorkers read - i bet it comes up at the debate ..... sanders' ignorance on the issues he yells about most was pretty shocking to me ...

2016-04-05	If Republicans hold open primaries how can you say those with the most votes should get the nomination? What you are doing is counting non-Republicans into the mix which is helpful to know, but not when it comes to that candidate accepting and following the party platform. Democrats and Independents can favor a candidate on free choice when Republicans favor the opposite. Its really up to the national convention to sort all this out in the end.
2016-04-05	Well at least it's not as bad as the Party leaders declaring that the primaries are meaningless because they and not the people choose the nominee

2016-04-05	Well Clinton should win tonight.
2016-04-05	I hope she wins, it would stun the Sanders camp, but if nothing else considering how he outspent her in the state by such a wide margin, and Wisconsin basically being tailor made for Sanders, if Clinton keeps it close it's a victory for Hillary!
2016-04-05	Wayne Anderson Yes; there's little chance Sanders can make up much ground in the delegate race - he has to win BIG, especially BIG states, to gain around 250 elected delegates more than Hillary. He can stay in the race, whatever - he does have his $ to spend, have fun with. If he doesn't catch her in elected delegates - what earthly reason would a majority of superdelegates switch to him for? To be anti-democratic?
2016-04-05	Even if Bernie wins by a modest margin - it won't help him much in delegates - mostly a feel-good win for him. Gonna take lots of delegates to catch Hillary now.
2016-04-05	Sounds like they want Clinton then .. right?

http://survivemagazine6354.blogspot.com

This is Donald Trump's most shocking statement yet,

However the mainstream media isn't saying a word about it!

What are they really trying to cover up?
I'm sending this to all my friends, family and patriot brothers......See More|
2016-04-05	You know it would be really cool if political commentators like Nick Gass could get the political spectrum through their thick heads that liberal and conservative are just polarisms that don't do justice to our diversity, not just on social and economic issues, but on how we understand government and the limits to authorization to represent and act on behalf of others.
2016-04-05	The Alt-Right nut jobs prefer Anarchy
2016-04-05	Michael Kelly alt nuts might be better for us and the world than mainstream lunatics out there blowing up the world and giving corporations control of everything, then hiding their wealth in Panama. My point is that liberals are not progressives. Progressives tend to be socialist democrats. And libertarian communists are quite different from these. Neolibs like Trump and Hillary are more authoritarian and right of center. Paul Rand is further right than that on economic issues, but also very libertarian...what is being coined anarchcapitalists (really a contradiction in terms). Both the RNC and DNC are basically fascists in politics, economics and social issues. A good discussion starter might be the self survey @ politicalcompass
2016-04-05	Makes me picture a baby hand grasping at straws.
2016-04-05	AKA: "We are about to get our asses kicked."
2016-04-05	Trump has consistently shown that he has a tenuous relationship with reality. Why would Wisconsin be any different?
2016-04-05	Trump is up against hundred of millions of hit ads, Neocon talk show hosts, and a popular Governor. He does pretty well with all the odds against him.
2016-04-05	Yes, and I'm sure that he'll blame all of them when he loses, instead of his vapid "policy proposals", ill-suited temperment, and racist rhetoric.

(Local, State and National, future and present)
It's up to YOU to pressure the GOP Leadership to NOT overpower the vote of the people and select a candidate for the Presidency not chosen by the MAJORITY of primary voters.
They apparently will not listen to US - the GOP registered voter.
Be mindful that MANY OF US will change our Registration to "Independent" and CANNOT and/or WILL NOT vote for YOU in upcoming elections.
I suggest YOU do the same if they persist in this nonsense. . :-<|
2016-04-05	Well since it looks like no one is going to have a majority of either primary votes or delegates I guess the GOP can do what it wants. And the trumpers can just piss off

2016-04-05	A real Republican should have some idea of how their primary process works. From what I can tell 99.9% of them are just finding out, including the front running candidate....
2016-04-05	Just to clarify, If Donald and his supporters are cheated, this voter will vote against every Republican on the ballot.
2016-04-05	please do!
2016-04-05	no you wont.. .you will fall in line and vote for there candidate. you will vote for who they tell you to vote for. you been doing it all these years why stop now. so shut up and stop having a tantrum and get ready to vote for who they tell you to vote for.

2016-04-05	Can someone decode that into English, with punctuation please?
2016-04-05	What's with this paternalist ish in referring to Bordallo primarily as the "former first lady"? She was the lieutenant governor for eight years (not under her husband) and has served as Guam's sole member in the House since 2003. Even if comparatively Clinton has spent most of her public life as first lady to Bill (12 years in Arkansas and 8 years in the White House), it would be ridiculous if you did that to her.
2016-04-05	I hear all the time about how illegal immigrants are supposedly "less likely" to commit crimes than the native population. How can that be, when their existence in the country is a crime?

2016-04-05	|They are less likely to commit crimes in this country because they do not want to be deported.

If you're legally here doing those jobs then congratulations. Your company probably still has under bid the project or Trump was given special incentives for hiring minorities to do the work. Either way, you have disrespected your employer for flying that discussing flag on his property.

Acts like that shows why most Americans don't respect your culture and why we want to build a wall and deport those here illegally.

I would have rather seen the work done by Canadians or real Americans. It is frightening to watch our jobs be given away to disrespectful A-holes..

Bring back our jobs and do away with special incentives. If you're legally here and capable of working then there shouldn't be any tax breaks or special incentives to hire companies to do any jobs in this country. The only people being discriminated against are the caucasians.

2016-04-05	Well I do very much have the option to go organic. However, my point being, by blaming the manufacturers you are removing a portion of the blame from criminals/committing parties in these atrocities. Are you saying that the people whole broke the law are less to blame than the companies that are simply profiting from a legal market that stems from and supports one of our constitutional rights? Are you saying that you feel that the actual murderer is not to blame here? But rather the person that makes an item that has neither the capability nor the consciousness to act without an outside party not only setting off a reaction but also aiming that reaction? And no, I am not a Bernie Sanders supporter. I am a constitutionalist libertarian. And this is simply a topic that mine and his opinions apparently align upon.

I don't think Romney was a better candidate than Cruz, and he came within a 2 point swing of unseating an incumbent president.

Hillary isn't an incumbent, is seen as untrustworthy by independents, has absolutely none of Obama's charisma, has serious problems with men as a voting bloc, and will have to fight the desire for a change after 8 years in office.

2016-04-05	There's two minutes of my life I'll never get back. Cruz = Reagan? Good gravy, when will you supporters stop confusing wishful thinking for reality? His politics are so woefully out of touch that you'd have to be a far right extremist to believe he's going to be a good president... oh wait.
2016-04-05	Correcdtion....you almost always win when turnout is all WHITE. And you almost always win in States with open primaries. Wonder how many of those percentage points were from crossover Republicans hoping beyond hope that you get nominated so that they can take the Presidency?
2016-04-05	Even though all the polls suggest he does better against the republicians than Hillary lets face it the republican party has destroyed itself this election im pretty sure both Hillary and Sanders would trounce them with how divided they are.
2016-04-05	|You mean he wins white states like Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii (24% white), which are among the top most ethnically and linguistically diverse states in the U.S? You mean he wins states with open primaries like the general election? And earning the votes of Independents are suddenly "Repulican crossovers?" You've been duped by the mainstream/corporate media. He has won 7 of last 8 with either significant or landslide margins and has the momentum moving forward to win NY.

The facts are that Bernie has created excitement and has increased voter turnout in record numbers across a number of states, and has the appeal of young voters (8 out of 10) and Independents (7 out of 10), which makes Bernie the strongest candidate in the general election, not only as a Democrat, but also against any replublican nominee period.

2016-04-05	|The hypocrisy of Team Bernie is Hillaryous. For months they said that if the superdelegates chose the nominee this was proof that the entire system was rigged and corrupt. Now their entire plan is to win with superdelegates.

But its even worse that that. Bernie says over and over again how hes against the insiders and the rich who rig the system
for their own advantage, yet he has as his top campaign aide a insider's insider and corporate bagman and influence peddler. Think Monsanto lobbyist and Bernie' top strategist and campaign chief Tad Devine paying himself $850,000 a month might be a reason to keep the campaign alive even after its clear that Sanders cant possibly win?.

Btw, thats 35,000 people who each month give this Bernie Bro hypocrite their $27 bucks.

2016-04-05	What about Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii (24% white), which are among the top most ethnically and linguistically diverse states in the U.S. Or does that not fit your false narrative? It's funny that the mainstream/corporate media (and Hillary supporters like yourself) only categorize a state as diverse ONLY if it has a significant black population and forget the fact that there are many other minorities that make up this great nation (and these groups are not monolithic I might add and there vote varies to some degree depending in the region they live in), in order to fit your false narrative by trying to downplay Bernie's message and achievements in this primary.
2016-04-05	|Edmond Kulla It's just DATA, Ed. For the most part ( not 100 percent) Bernie wins the whiter states with open primaries and caucuses with a black population of 10 percent or less. That's just data. HRC generally wins ( not always) when the states are closed primaries and more diverse. That is not personal...it's just data. Bernie would do well to learn from HRC how to get the black vote, and she would do well to learn from him how to get the younger vote...and how to get people enthused.

Democrats are terrified of Cruz because they know he will not "pivot", he will stick to his promises to the voters and he will follow a real conservative agenda. They know if he is elected and the GOP keeps both houses of Congress, Obamacare is dead. They know all of Obama's executive orders are dead, the Iran deal is dead.

Perhaps Ted can teach him how to behave like a grown-up and write like a man trying to become the President of the United States.

2016-04-06	Bernie is the Democrat. Hillary is Republican light.
2016-04-06	Could Hillary have answered those questions better, really? He's more true to the FDR roots and spirit of the Democratic Party, and it can be argued that her corporate ties and unthoughtful use of her private email server are examples of how she's not presidential material.
2016-04-06	I will have to listen to the Daily News, but it is not merely being glib or polished, it is having the right values and judgement. And don't rule out a third party run. If polls indicate he could win running third party there will be huge pressure to do so. He is the most popular of all the candidates as he would split the democratic vote and capture 2/3 of the independents, and if Cruz or Trump is the Republican he would capture 10% of the Republican vote.

2016-04-06	|I know the comments section of news sites tend to be a repository of bias anger and venting akin to clubbing each other over the head like cavemen, but Bernie’s win in Wisconsin has made one thing clear - neither side can call the other, “small potatoes”.

To this point, ignoring or alienating the other supporters could be a serious problem for whoever wins the nomination. I am a Bernie supporter. I may be a traitor to some by saying I will vote for Hillary if she gets the nomination, but it seems to me that it’s the potential traitors that will have to step up, to give Bernie or Hillary a win for the WH. As someone who dreads the thought of any Republican winning I am willing to risk the scorn.|
2016-04-06	Unlike the republican side this election cycle, I see no evidence that Dems are truly divided. The divisions were much more bitter in 2008 Obama - Clinton race, yet the fears of Clinton's primary voters not voting for Obama in the general election did not materialize. There is even less chance of that now. I'm a Bernie's supporter but even though I wouldn't be entirely thrilled to vote for Hillary in November, I will have no problem voting for her. And I'd definitely be thrilled to vote against Trump or Cruz, or whomever the GOP manages to dredge up as their nominee.

2016-04-06	Not a fan of Cruz, but I think the upshot is he's substantially more careful about what he says and how he says it. A lot of the animosity about Cruz is that he's a tad or very much unscrupulous in his execution of certain power plays, sometimes showing very little loyalty (apparently). That's not a admirable trait in a human, but it makes for less embarassing elections, and at the very least he's more on board with a consensus view of how the economy should work (foreign policy he's said some outlandishly aggressive things, but within general policy limits, up to a point; not "let's end our relationship with Saudi Arabia" or things like that). I will say this, if he wrestles it away at the convention, I'll be like, "Holy crap, you placed this bet last May, and somehow you were right."
2016-04-06	Wait until all of his affairs come out in public! Cruz is a tool!

2016-04-06	|Well, here's an article that details some of the things your candidate has accomplished:
http://www.thecrimson.com/art.../2016/3/1/Dont-trust-bernie/|
2016-04-06	Mike Gardner - while your huckster, the great Bernie, was laying around collecting unemployment until he got his first job at the age of forty, Hillary was out there working hard to improve the lives of others. If you had an open mind and read her bio, you might learn something about someone dedicating their life to public service.
2016-04-06	|Liz Hinnant And this video details what a lying fraud Hillary is vs. Bernie who's been on the right side of history for decades.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpm4rjejFgQ&nohtml5=False|
2016-04-06	|"She expected the Vermont senator to fight on, but has been aggravated by Sanders’ aggressiveness and how willing his team is to go after her by name (“There is, as you well know, a very negative, intense barrage of attacks on anybody who supports me. I did not see that in '08,” she said). "

OMG....when he criticizes me....he uses my name....
that's like, so agressively negative....bummer man...|
2016-04-06	|Hillary thinks Sanders is aggressive?
She doesn't know from aggressive!|
2016-04-06	How exactly has she been attacked and why has no one followed up on that statement when she claims that. Someone telling the truth is not an attack, or is it? Now, I'm confused.
2016-04-06	|Bill Boehmer Snarky crybaby "feels sorry for" young voters who embrace her competition and his message.
She will never get the youth vote our any vote with such condescension.|
2016-04-06	If all reporters asked questions like Glenn Thrush just did here, Hillary would be more accessible. She was very, very accessible to individual members of the news media in Iowa for over nine months.
2016-04-06	Hillary likes local reporters because most are in a swoon for having been "granted" an interview with a national candidate. They are uninformed, rarely challenging, and write fawning stories that ignore the larger national issues or controversies. It is not the job of th Fourth Estate to simply record a candidate's sound bites but to serve as a governor over their b.s.
2016-04-06	She has a lot to hide now tho :))) wouldnt want anyone to know about how she's still a hardcore republican. Shh

2016-04-06	Yes Donald Trump and Ted Cruz A/K/AMini Trump the two most hated Republicans in the GOP are ready to battle it out at the GOP convention. And surging in the polls by his account only is Governor Kasich who is camped out in Pennsylvania and is finishing a whopping 3rd place finish again. In the polls. Interviewed earlier by ABC Governor Kasich stated that he is having too much fun running to be king to go back to Ohio. I mean really who gets paid as a governor, a paid in full security detail all paid by the voters in Ohio. I mean I get to travel all over the place having fun coming in dead last all the time and I still keep this gig up. Well there you have it. The GOP at its finest.

2016-04-06	Hillary Assad Secretary of State follows the orders of the Commander in Chief. We never invaded Syria or Libya and Bush was given authorization to go to war and chose to go under false pretenses. That’s why your statement was RUBBISH. Now I see why you only posted the same comments because you have no idea.
2016-04-06	Hillary Assad As you stated, "a plan"; it has never been implemented because she is not the Commander in Chief. The circumstances on the ground maybe totally different if or when she becomes CIC.

2016-04-06	|Every poll in every state has shown Clinton with "insurmountable" double digit leads. Hell, 538 even gave her an 80% of winning New Hampshire until a few weeks before their primary. But in nearly every state (outside the South), Bernie has closed the gap and ended up getting far more votes than the early and even late polls predicted.

Having a closed Primary will make it a bit challenging, but if people volunteer we can do this.

2016-04-06	College kid wanting a revolution for free things. The Democrat Party has always been the party of the people. Some people know who to get things done within the party- like Clinton, while others like Sander's haven't done much in the years he has spent in Congress. And, funny, he is an insider, part of the establishment, having been a Senator for many years, yet he lies and bills himself as antiestablishment.
2016-04-06	Margie Vogel The koolaid is strong with you. For starters, you sound like a Republican. Nobody is asking for "free" things, just better ways of doing things that enhance the quality of life of Americans and future of our nation. For instance, universal healthcare by opening up Medicare For All will cost a new payroll tax of 2.2% (poorest of the poor likely exemted or subject to refund), but this will save most Americans many thousands of dollars per year. If it works in every other developed nation, why not here? Why do we persist with a costly, deadly for-profit system? Oh yeah, Clinton is th...See More
2016-04-06	Margie Vogel "an insider, part of the establishment, having been a Senator for many years." That's an accurate description of Hillary Clinton.

2016-04-06	She's not leadership material. She knows what it looks and sounds like because she's memorized it. But every time a chance came for her to do it, she blew it. She's not up to it.
2016-04-06	|Wrong. Further, for the record, here is what Hillary said: “There is a persistent, organized effort to misrepresent my record, and I don’t appreciate that, and I feel sorry for a lot of the young people who are fed this list of misrepresentations,” Clinton said. “I know that Senator Sanders spends a lot of time attacking my husband, attacking President Obama. I rarely hear him say anything negative about George W. Bush, who I think wrecked our economy.”

Hey Axelrod, she did NOT call Sanders supporters dupes – the word ‘dupes’ is not even mentioned in her comment. Hillary said that many yo...See More|
2016-04-06	|New York Daily News released its transcript of the editioral meeting with Bernie Sanders, with the editors asking serious and well thought-out questions about policy, and Sanders revealed that he is ignorant on a host of important issues (just like the GOP Presidential nominees) and he is in WAY, WAY over his head. It is painfully and embarrassingly clear from his interview with the NY Daily News, that he has empty slogans but no ideas with specific and detail solutions. Hillary is clearly more qualified and prepared to be POTUS than Bernie, Trump, Cruz, and Kasich.

2016-04-06	"She's not leadership material" . . . You are CLUELESS. Currently Hillary has more votes and delegates than ANY of the Democrat or Republican presidential nominees. Hillary is MORE qualified to be president than Bernie, Trump, and ANY of the presidential nominees, and she advocates policies that support women, all races, and all Americans: She has spent 8 yrs in the U.S. Senate on the Armed Service Committee, served on other committees on the budget, foreign policy, the environment, transportation, health, workplace safety, pensions, and children, families and the aging, she supports civil...See More

2016-04-06	She didn't insult them. She said that Bernie Sanders is misrepresenting her and some of her policies and where her campaign funds are coming from. David Axelrod said that they were "dupes".
2016-04-06	Don't worry - I won't vote for her no matter what. I don't vote for war mongers.
2016-04-06	Brendan Connell So!!!! It happens every election year. Someone chose a different candidate. It will happen to Bernie, Trump, Cruz and everyone else who is running for office.
2016-04-06	She did not say they were "dupes". He should not have made that statement. Bernie Sanders is misrepresenting Hillary Clinton to people. However, we see in the Daily Mail interview that all he has is slogans and no concrete plans to deliver what he is promising to people. He is Trumpesque in the way he is running his campaign. On CNN last night when they did the math even if Bernie wins every state 55/45 and you don't include the superdelegates Bernie Sanders still will have less delegates than Hillary. We know she will win some of the upcoming states like NY and CA and more of the delegate rich states. Bernie Sanders can run as long as he wants but, he needs to stop lying and saying he has a path to the White House.
2016-04-06	No, she didn't use the word "dupes." But, that's what it sounded like to me. Not that she's wrong. Most voters (both parties) will vote straight party line no matter what. And that's the majority of voters. But, newer voters are looking for someone different. So, they grab on to the new kid in town (even if he's 74), but, don't really understand the issues or what it means to support a given candidate. I seen dozens of interviews on different networks talking to the people on the street and most can't even identify why they actually support their candidate.
2016-04-06	Michael Rehkamp Well then I heard something very different than you, because I heard nothing like that at all.
2016-04-06	Agreed. Bernie is being hypocritical, disingenuous, and LYING when he tries to pretend that he does not accept money from various groups, when he DOES accept money from voters, Wall Street, etc. The Washington Post gave Bernie 3 Pinocchio’s for lying. Per the Center for Responsive Politics, Clinton AND Bernie has received donations from fossil fuel workers and donors who have ties to the oil and gas industry. Bernie rails against Wall St. contributions and the Campaign Finance System, but he IGNORES the fact that he indirectly took about $200,000 from Wall Street firms and lobbyists through t...See More
2016-04-06	Clinton is the worst.
2016-04-06	pathetic! clinton has been on the wrong side of history time after time. Bernie has been on the right side of history time after time. How her supporters keep supporting her is beyond me. Low info voters. They are sucked in and DUPED by her network the Clinton News Network (CNN) which is owned by time warner and contributes to her campiagn. So it's their job to blackout Bernie or say negative things about him at the service of their obviously corrupt canidate. Go figure.
2016-04-06	Texans for Higher Order Thinking Skills Was Bernie on the right side of history when he was a part of the Socialist Workers Party, a communist group following the teachings of Trotsky, at 39 years old? A lot of us were kind of radical when we were young but this is kind of like W growing up when he hit 40 and deciding that it no longer made sense to go out to bars and cheat on his wife. Maybe it doesn't matter to younger people but there is a reason why he isn't getting much of the vote from people over 40. It doesn't look like a problem for him in the primary, but you can bet it would be in the general.
2016-04-06	Texans for Higher Order Thinking Skills From your post, Your name is absolutely LMAO ironic. Why? You're clueless And ignorant.
2016-04-06	Young people like Hillary? Where? In what universe? This should breaking news in all the news networks

2016-04-06	Ummmm nope, you people don't like you Hillary, in fact, most people don't like you.

While there are a lot of younger voters, there are more older ones.

2016-04-06	And yet Bernie is still losing. She seems to be a lot more graceful than you are. But I've come to realize Bernie supporters, not all but many, are just vicious. How many are actually Dems, outside socialists, or even conservative activists trying to tip the scale is hard to tell, but this is definitely not a Democrat running against her.

I am a registered Democrat, if it matters. I am also someone who has been fighting for families and poor people in the courts throughout this entire 2000's to present time period. I know what she has done because I have been one of the people that have to go in and clean up the mess. I know the votes that she made that were harmful and I know the votes that she should have shown up to fight against but could not be bothered. Again, BAPCPA pretty much is it in a nutshell. If you can't understand that, then you won't ever understand how she sells out the poor.|
2016-04-06	Mark Keeler - Mark, you're absolutely right. This is not a Democrat running against Hillary and it's terrifically unfair how vicious he and his supporters have become. Apart from my unwavering, strong support of Clinton, I'm furious at the inept Sanders and the terrible disservice his dispicable campaign is doing to Hillary and to the Democratic Party. Still, I know that the math is with Hillary and that she will still win the Presidency!
2016-04-06	And if you believe anything Carpetbagger Clinton says, then I will gladly sell you the Alamo, the USS Texas, and the San Jacinto Monument.
2016-04-06	Your problem is that no one - absolutely no one - wants anything from Texas except for the state to stop sending morons (Louie Gohmert) to congress and equally stupid presidential candidates (Cruz).
2016-04-06	|Sanders got it right in the interview about breaking the banks, its the jornalist who was mistaken, lol! Also, about how sure she is to be the nominee, since August last year she created a loophole with DNC for big donors, via her Vicotry Fund and bought the loyalty of 33 democratic states. You can find the article on this subject googling. As for if he was or not botch in the NYDN , I suhhest to read a paper on the Huffington Post onlinem that is very accurate and, the writer is not a pro-sander, just to notice.

Sanders is running for presidency and NYDM was asking him legislative stuff. Clinton scripted interviews would never ever be able to formulate a single try answer. Sanders knows the specifics of some issues, as his debates have proven it.

"Don't be afraid to vote for Sanders"!|
2016-04-06	Sounds like you read the HuffPo article. Many others disagree with that analysis and that wasn't the only thing he said that got him in trouble. He blew it on everything from gun seller immunity to how to deal with ISIS.

2016-04-06	Your crazy!!!!! Lolololololol
2016-04-06	The article is right on! John Kasich can win the "general", and an experienced Presidential REPUBLICAN candidate who can balance the budget, and has international "smarts". (IMHO, Trump is not only dangerous and stupid, he is a Democrat & definately can not work well with others).
2016-04-06	Boy, I sure wish I was as stupid as Trump, I'd be a billionaire by now! He would not have the successful business if he could not work well with others. Maybe, just maybe you need to listen w/your ears and not your mouth before you spout off on something you obviously haven't thought thru. I get it, you hate Trump and want to do everything you can to smear him. But understand, Kasich has no chance of winning, & if he leap frogs over Cruz or Trump, there will be an uproar. Besides, why would Kasich want to be President knowing the people of the majority of the people don't want him and he stole an election. Not a good way to start out.
2016-04-06	Brenda Hartford ... & how can "you" want something, that you do not recognize as valuable. Kasich is too subtle for most people to initially "get"- he would be excellent in "diplomacy". Example; CA relatives said who is he" , recently got to to know KASICH, and then the response was: "like him for President".
2016-04-06	As a Republican I'd rather see Clinton or Sanders be president than see Cruz or Trump ruin the country. Kasich is the last reasonable hope for the party in 2016 and I'm sure as hell not going to be one of those that voted for one of the two idiots that cause a major economic collapse or world war or maybe even both.

2016-04-06	|Those votes do not take into account millions of votes Bernie has won in landslide victories in caucus states, so its misleading at best. The delegate lead is closer to 220 after Wisconsin, and much lower to 170-180 when you take into account the majority of delegates from Washington state, in which Bernie won in a landslide, that have yet to be awarded officially until middle of June, given the caucus process. Bernie certainly has the momentum to win NY as he is closing the gap in the polls the last couple of weeks just like he did in Wisconsin, in which Bernie turned a 7-8 point deficit into a 13 point defeat of Hillary Clinton.

We've made a good effort to have I's register Dem in the upcoming closed states.

2016-04-06	|Yeah, this is all getting annoying. If you factor in Washington, and an 80/20 Wyoming win for Sanders, he will still be roughly 210 delegates behind Clinton.

I expect a close Clinton win in NY and PA, and a pretty good Clinton win in MD. CT and DE are up in the air because like it or not, both of them are pro-business states. CT is full of insurance companies, and DE is a situs haven.

2016-04-06	Well put. Unfortunatly Bernie and his supporters are like W and do not believe in math. They use "fuzzy" math, deny reality, believe in utopia dreams coming true, live in an alternate reality. Sounds a lot like republicans to me.
2016-04-06	Indiana will go for Hillary all the way--too smart in Indiana, too well-educated to believe in dreams that are not reality--dreams are good when they can be reality, but even in the recent interview, Bernie admitted he doesn't know the first thing about what he needs to do to accomplish what he is preaching. Also a bit conservative in Indiana and Indiana has always loved the Clintons and Clintons have lots of friends in Indiana. After all she won against Obama in 2008 when people were saying the same then about Obama taking Indiana. Don't get me wrong, lots of Bernie supporters in Indiana, my young relatives some of them :). I probably shouldn't have said this because now I will jinx her and Indiana :), always my luck so I best be quiet!!
2016-04-06	Shelley McCracken Paul Rania I agree Indiana is smart and well educated, that is why Hillary will not win there. People there will actually look at her records, of war mongering, wall street sell out and job exporting, and will drop her like a hot potato.
2016-04-06	|I wonder how CNN -Clintons' News Network, is negotiaing on the dark, the debate questions... Yep, big win in Wisconsin so Clintons' get harder on her disqualify SAnders mantra, now.

"Vote Sanders"!|
2016-04-06	|No, the fact is that the so called big win is only going to get him a dozen or so delegates. They say 10 in the article, but I think it is closer to 12. The problem is that he is still down by well over 200 delegates. Even after Wyoming he will be down +200 delegates.

He had a nice little run, but it was expected. After Wyoming, it is back to the east coast. Far more minorities (especially AA's), they are primaries, not caucuses, and they are closed.|
2016-04-06	|Mark Hendricks and yet he's still out raising her, without any corporate support. Money is power in politics, and the passion for Bernie is real. If he loses the primary, he should take his fundraising abilities and use it to add firepower to every progressive candidate running. Then in eight years get another Bernie endorsed progressive on the ballot, and I think they'll clean up.

I think Clinton will make a good president, working within the confines of the system as is, but I also think it's embarrassing for her that with all her entrenched support in both the party and the media, Bernie has made her fight this hard, this long.

The desire for change which goes beyond mere window dressing is real, and if Bernie plays his hand well, his revolution could be well underway.|
2016-04-06	"Trump Effect" is a corollary to the law of unintended consequences. It refers to the perverse effects that flow from any idiotic proposal, statement or behavior which kicks "Murphy's Law" into play. A good example would be Trump's proposed U.S/Mexico border wall. The cost quickly escalated from 4 billion to 20 billion increasing the deficit and causing U.S. ladder companies to flock to Mexico.

2016-04-06	|Donald Trump said that he is prepared to block money transfers that are the only income of poor Mexican families in order to force the Mexican government to pay $20 million for his wall. It wouldn't work - there are too many ways to move money - but the fact that Trump would propose starving children as a policy tool shows a total lack of concern for anyone but himself.

There is no way Donald Trump can be trusted as Commander in Chief and holder of the nuclear launch codes.|

2016-04-06	Trump is a child man, we can't trust him to lead this Country specially now that we are facing so many problems, he is a flip floper the truth is not in Him, actually he is very dangerous person he doesn't know right from wrong, please people wake up and vote for the most conservative with proven votes TED CRUZ.
2016-04-06	|I strongly urge you to reconsider your vote. Ted Cruz is just another politician trying to tell us the sky isn't blue.
He's a slick laywer turned politician, with his wife and mother having ties to big banking. Why take such as risk on another dirty (we already know he's a liar) lawyer-politician hybrid, when we know Trump will, without a doubt, trim the fat and be a whistle blower? It's time to get somebody in office who will call bullshit when they see it. Cruz is accepting money from big banks... I can't trust that! Trump is the only one not taking bribes and is talking a good game, while Cruz has tuned his message completely around since first running, to be more in line with what Trump is saying.
Is Trump crass? Yes. But that in no way impedes him from doing a great job.|
2016-04-06	Alex DeLarge Actually you are completely wrong, Trump is the establishment, he donates money to the Democrats and some Republicans in order to get what he wants, actually he owes favors to most of the politicians and wall street banks, you need to do a little homework in your part, he is a Decoy Alex do not be deceived by tramp, Cruz actually is the best candidate we ever had in decades.
2016-04-06	Pilar Eibeck Best candidate? That is why media is powerful. Media can brainwash voters like Pilar.
2016-04-06	Trump added a few delegates to his total in Wisconsin. He won two congressional districts in spite of having being attacked relentlessly, 24/7 on talk radio shows, TV Ads, the Republican establishment machine and the biased national mainstream media plus both, lying Ted and Ka-sick !!!
2016-04-06	There are not as many stupid people in Wisconsin, that is why he only got six delegates!!!
2016-04-06	Paul Guzman no they are retarted not stupid and that is from incest breeding like most red states they incest breed for that S.S check
2016-04-06	Dan Pomerico I've lived around the country and the people you described are in every state. And you should have said welfare check instead of SS check. You may not be familiar with the concept, but working people pay into SS, so that money is already theirs. Welfare recipients are largely voting Democrat, so I'm puzzled at why you would associate them with Republicans.
2016-04-06	6 of 42? Oh, hell. No biggy. That's 15% of the delegates! So while Forrest Trump NEEDS 60 or 70% of the remaining delegates to get the nomination, using TRUMP math, he's a shoe in! LOL

2016-04-06	|If you want to look at negative campaigning, go no further than HRC herself. In this election she's enlisted the services of sleazeball David Brock, whose claim to fame is having smeared Anita Hill so Clarence Thomas could get a life-time SCOTUS apointment. DailyKOS had this to say about her main sleaze-ball advisor:

"David Brock is one of those sleazy practitioners. Brock cut his teeth as a right wing attack dog, smearing Anita Hill for daring to offer negative testimony about Clarence Thomas during Thomas’ Senate confirmation hearing. ...

The one consistent thing about Brock, from his college years through the present day, is his reputation for being a liar and a slimeball.

And, yet, this is the guy Hillary Clinton and her campaign have chosen to be their “go-to” attack dog." (See http://www.dailykos.com/.../-David-Brock-is-the-symptom...)

And then there were the HRC and surrogate's disgusting racially charged attacks on Obama in 2008. Hillary is the QUEEN of sleaze.|
2016-04-06	|When asked if Sanders will help down ballot democrats, Sanders said "Well, we'll see".
Sanders has an awesome fundraising machine. How much has he contributed to democrats?
Sanders only "became" a democrat a few months ago and admitted that it was for the exposure.

Now he is mad because he feels the DNC has their thumb on the scale? (They do, but being mad about it seems stupid considering the above).|
2016-04-06	And how will he ever get any of the snake oil he's selling through Congress unless down ballot Reps get elected? It's what he's all about. All blow with no plans.
2016-04-06	|If you haven't noticed, Bernie is in the middle of running a primary. The minute he starts giving my money to corporate Democrats is the moment I stop donating to the Sanders campaign.

Now is not the time to be asking these questions. After the primary is over Sanders can decide who he'd like to support. Frankly, I'd rather him save this money for 2018 so we can use it to oust the corporate lackeys like Claire McCaskill.|
2016-04-06	|Jason Ward - Pretty sure Hillary is in the same race. She raised over $15M for down ballot dems in the 1st quarter of this year. But you statement is the issue of why he will never get anything passed. How do you expect to get ANYTHING through congress when you don't support down ballot candidates.

That right there is a nutshell of what is wrong with the Sanders campaign. They are just milking you for money because even THEY know they can't legislate a far left agenda from the executive office.

President Sanders to the dems in congress. "I know this is going to be tough on many of you in your districts and states, but I'm really going to need you to go out on a limb and support this proposal".

dems in congress to Sanders. "With all due respect, F*** you,....... sir...."|

It's not called the DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST National Committee. BTW, that's a name Bernie made up out of thin air. There is no such party.
2016-04-06	So he wants the Democratic Nomination even though he hates Democrats?! This guy is one fringy FLAKE!
2016-04-06	You're just plain ignorant. Sanders has caucused with the Democrats in Congress since he was first elected to the House in the 90s. He has a better voing record on Democratic issues that many of Hillary's 'blue dog' and 'New' Democrat supporters.
2016-04-06	Jim Albers Sanders caucuses with the Democrats so he won't forever be a powerless back bencher.

2016-04-06	Lol. Nothing is going to prompt them to lower their prices, even if costs went to zero.
2016-04-06	Ya, they are barely making ends meet. It's ok, single mothers and other hard working Americans are there to help poor old big pharmaceutical. It's the least we can do for all the affordable drugs they make for us

2016-04-06	I guess that was the big surprise the Trump was predicting.
2016-04-06	Losing by 13 pts and losing in the delegate count 6 to 1 is not a "win". It is a butt kicking and Trump's campaign staff know this is #4 in a row. Trump's last win was Arizona. Since then he has picked up a total of 7 delegates. In contrast, Cruz has picked up 96. Looking at the most recent polls out of NY, the race has changed. Cruz has moved past Kasich. In PA, Maryland, and California, Trump's double digit leads have vanished and Cruz is within striking distance. The other reality the Trump supporters and media keep ignoring is in EVERY contest so far, Cruz has outperformed the polls and Trump underperformed. Last night was another example of this truth. Cruz for 8% more than polls showed and Trump got 3% less. Taking that into account, Cruz wins, Pa, Maryland and most of California. The one last truth is GOP voters are realizing not only is Trump a lunatic, he is not a conservative
2016-04-06	He led in the polls a couple of weeks ago and they got their butts handed to them last night.
2016-04-06	Do Trump people ever stop lying? Trump was up in the polls all along except for the last 2 weeks. BTW- we need more cheap shots taken by Trump people against the supporters of other candidates, women and/or minorities- you're getting lazy.

He has narrowed the gap among black voters considerably. He is now only down by 26 points. This is why he is winning nationally, it's why he is now only down 10 points in NY and down only 6 points in PA.

Sure, his ideas are much different, but the net effect will be a loss overall for the nation. Another wasted four years as we had under Carter.

2016-04-06	|State Department: Don’t Ask Hillary Aides About Classified Info in Lawsuit

But U.S. district judge Emmet Sullivan (appointed by bill clinton) expressed his frustration in a hearing last February. “It appears that no one took any steps to ensure that agency records on Clintonemail.com were secured within the State Department's record systems” in order to respond to records requests in the future, Sullivan said. “How in the world could this happen?”
At one point, Sullivan asked rhetorically, “Was the system created to accommodate the former secretary? Was the system created to thwart [Freedom of Information Act] compliance?”

Like a hyena hiding in the weeds while the lions fight then sneak out and take the food (appointed nomination). Sickening.

Cruz is being used as a pawn by the establishment to stop Trump. Once they reach the convention he will be discarded like a cig butt. He is being played. Really think Graham, Mittens, Bush, etc like him??

Reince Priebus sneakily stated the nominee will be a candidate running. This doesn't mean just Trump, Cruz and Kasich but ALL 17. They only SUSPENDED their campaigns. The establishment has a plan to parachute one of them in.

Sounds crazy but Trump/Cruz better get a plan together or we're getting a puppet foisted on us.

2016-04-06	|The lack of affordable housing is a symptom of a larger problem: income and wealth inequality. Gentrification is what is driving housing prices up. As the earners on top look for their sixteenth and seventeeth homes, affordable tenements are bulldozed to make room for luxurious high-rises which are bought by Russian oligarchs, Chinese billionaires, and Wall Street cocaine-addicts.

Guess what? Property is wealth. Guess what? The top 1% own as much wealth as the bottom 90%. Guess what? That's why housing is unaffordable. Guess what? Nobody addresses this inequality more than Sen. Sanders.

All that said, I agree that he needs a policy specifically to address affordable housing in major urban areas. It's a problem that can't wait for the redistributive effects of his agenda to kick in and, in a lot of cases, housing policy is a major source of institutionalized racism.|

2016-04-06	if Republicans do not want Cruz, why should we?
2016-04-06	As a New Hampshire resident, I can say that Ayotte is right to be this desperate about her chances for re-election. The GOP slime machine has dumped millions into our state already to prop up Ayotte and the contest is still very close, even though Hassan hasn't even started really campaigning yet. Ayotte has to answer for being weak on public gun safety, for eagerly signing up to be the third stooge in the doomed attempt to keep the Benghazi non-scandal alive, and now for deciding to ignore her constitutional responsibility to advise and consent on a Supreme Court nomination. She has no accomplishments in the Senate other than being a reliable GOP party cog. We need better.

2016-04-06	Ayotte and the GOP are clearly getting desperate. By this logic, Ted Cruz should be held accountable for his wife working at Goldman Sachs when Wall St. tanked and cost countless Americans their life savings.

to her lead in CA.|
2016-04-06	Everyone I know in California is a Sanders supporter. How are the polls you're looking at being conducted? I know the ones that I have seen for New York were conducted by calling landlines, which are overwhelmingly limited to the older generations, and thus would be skewed towards HRC.

2016-04-06	He's the worst thing to happen to the 2016 campaign. Can't wait for Hillary shut him off after NY.
2016-04-06	A study released last month found that almost 10 percent of Bernie Sanders supportes are feeling the bern for Donald Trump, and they are "working-class Americans."
2016-04-06	What working people need to hear from Bernie is how he intends to do any of the things he says he will do. I don't think any democrats have a problem with what Bernie wants....it's just that most of us know that what he wants can't be done .... of course, Bernie has no idea how they're to be done also....something that the NY media will be pressing him on. Clinton has solutions that can be accomplished and will be steps toward what, as democrats, we all want.
2016-04-06	|YOU ALL FORGET MANY OTHER FACTORS:
ex: any EDUCATED Delegates know Shillary is TOXIC (and hated by ALL parties) (as 2008 proved irrefutably: her OWN party rejected her for the unknown and "unelectable" novice).... it's clear SHE IS THE GOP'S ONLY HOPE TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. ANY other Democrat would literally have been a wiser choice.

Her scandals are worse than any other candidate in HISTORY! From DOMA to war crimes to her admitted crimes in Servergate (and NO, I'm not talking about classified emails so don't mention that red herring)... she's A DISASTER.

Hell, TRUMP could defeat her with literally 2 words:

"IRAQ WAR".

You're going to see the DNC ESTABLISHMENT realize Shillary sinks the more voters hear her phoniness.|
2016-04-06	Okay Andy, tell us what these admitted crimes in 'servergate' are. You distort what happened in 2008. Obama was and unknown, but, we (his supporters) all knew he was electable....and it was the super-d's who put him over the top. You honestly think that the DNC establishment is going to suddenly realize anything new about Hillary after the many years she's been working and fighting for them? No, they will stick with her, and rightfully so. Barack Obama was a better candidate than Hillary and deserved his two terms in office. Bernie Sanders is NO Barack Obama!
2016-04-06	You are right -- Hillary has incredibly huge, wide-spread and historic baggage going back 30 years, and any GOP candidate would destroy her. She can't win the general election.
2016-04-06	Susan Burke youre right - hes better.
2016-04-06	I stopped reding after this statement "Even if Sanders does surpass Clinton in New York and subsequent states, it’s still very unlikely he can accrue enough delegates to overtake Clinton – let alone win a majority among the pledged delegates to counter Clinton’s current edge with unpledged superdelegates."
2016-04-06	That is what is most important...and true.
2016-04-06	Susan Burke vote for her he wins it really is that simple.
2016-04-06	It is Yuuge!
2016-04-06	Well there's one, only a few thousand more politicians to go.
2016-04-06	Every time I log in lately someone from the GOP is being accused of something bad. Heck, Hillary looks like a nun compared to these guys. Hastert, Schock and the sleezy govenor of Alabama. AMAZING

2016-04-06	I like Bernie, but he needs to stay on message and give more vision like he said he would. When you do the things your opponent does their no difference in you and the person you're blasting. Suggestion: Stay with the politics and not compare with the military. We have the greatest fighting force in the world, but we have the same problems in the military that they have in politics, dishonest leaders who do things for their personal, and sometimes attacking others for gain when it’s not needed. Military doesn’t want to say it out loud, but’s it’s real. Voting for the candidate with a clear vision, and will take of our vets.
2016-04-06	He is a jerk.

2016-04-06	Rosalie Fontaine He's either going to lose the Dem nomination or the general election. My preference would be the nomination - so the Dem Party doesn't have ot gamble on the electability (or not) of an openly socialist candidate. There's too much at stake, for years (Supreme Court; environmental, civil, labor, and voting rights, etc.) to throw it away. Repubs HOPE we'll choose Bernie; they'll trounce him as a far-out wacko.
2016-04-06	This NY primary is going to be awesome! Give 'em hell Bernie! The national mainstream media will continue to campaign for Hillary, but the competitive NY tabloid press will go after both sides, as they already have. I can't wait!
2016-04-06	I agree, but for different reasons than you.

2016-04-06	|Drew Wenger third paragraph: http://theweek.com/.../bernie-sanders-2016-lot-common...
Funny thing, facts, and the archive of the Internet.|
2016-04-06	Tony Gamino - You're exactly right, Tony. Among other things this clown Bernie ought to apologize for getting Dubya elected by supporting Nader. Most of all, however, he owes Hillary a MAJOR apology for lying and saying she said he was unqualified to be President. The irony is, of course, that Sanders IS deeply unfit to be President and never will be.
2016-04-06	What! What does a parent asking for an apology from Bernie, does he then say Hillary should apologize to our men and women of the Iraq war, and the trade agreements of her husbands presidency. This thing is getting one sided. The final decision for the war was Bush and Cheney and Hillary did support her husband. What else would she have done. Obama picked Hillary as his secretary of state and Biden as his vice president (who voted for the Iraq was also). Enough said
2016-04-06	How about all the parents in Iraq who lost children due to the Iraq war? Sounds like HRC should apologize for that.

Expect them to see them crying more than celebrating from April 19 to the end of this month when the Northeastern primaries start a week after New York's. Ted Cruz is going to get his Texan buttocks kicked twice this month, the second time much more deeper than the first.

2016-04-06	"the second time much more deeper than the first?" What??
2016-04-06	Who cares... the guy is in his home state in a republican primary... he'll act like this is the biggest win of the primary season. Of course he's going to win his home state, just like cruz smacked trump down in texas and kasich won Ohio. The guy will still end up the biggest general election loser since mondale.
2016-04-06	Why not Cruz people acted like him winning Texas was the greatest thing possible.
2016-04-06	Heck Trump is *from* NY. Maybe he will *finally* get over 50% of the vote in a Primary.

Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver late Tuesday accused the Clinton camp of trying to "tear the party apart." "Don't destroy the Democratic Party to satisfy the secretary's ambitions to become president of the United States," Weaver told CNN. "Let's not denigrate each other's supporters and tear the party apart." "The senator has tried to run an issue-oriented campaign; obviously the contrast has become sharper of late," he added. "We're fully prepared to engage in that environment if they want to."

Bernie should have said Israel has killed 10,000 Palestinians since 2000, and he would have been spot on, and that the UN declared that 7 out of 10 Palestinains killed In Gaza were (are) civilians. Nothing libelous about that, just facts.

2016-04-07	|As an outsider (from The Netherlands) it's facinating and scary to see...
Daily News wrote a hit piece, that i hope everybody can agree on. Simple the fact that some of the questions where just false/wrong and they did cherry picking for maximum effect.

Next level is the media who jumped right on it. Scary to see that it's all linked to the same owners and the fact that these owners are also in the top10 of donors to Clinton.|
2016-04-07	What??? Bernie Sanders is pushing Israel toward Obama. This is priceless. President Obama has already locked Hillary Clinton down to his hip. And, he just might be able to force the Republican party into a breakup. He already showed that Russia's power will not extend beyond Ukraine. President Obama is a master at statecraft.
2016-04-07	Hugh Johnson When? He's only said that about Clinton.
2016-04-07	|So now the fracturing of the GOP (brought on by years of carefully cultivated anger provided by Limbaugh, Hannity and their ilk, and fostered by McTurtle and the 'try for eight years to make Obama a four-year president' club) is "Obama forcing the Republican party into a breakup"?

2016-04-07	LOL another example of the Mini Trumpster cheating the law. He learned very well from the old man Donald Trump.
2016-04-07	Trump doesn't accept money from PAC's. Obviously Cruz did not learn to deal with or subvert the law by getting companies to donate above their legal limit from him. I like how you somehow twisted this into being about Trump when it has nothing to do with him. You should work for Cruz!
2016-04-07	Computer Hero give me a break. Trump plays a little known game called bait and switch. You see he loans his campaign money and then he solicits money for his campaign so he can pay back all the money he has loaned himself. Only rich people can do this. Who needs a PAC. It is slimy and discusting. So what Ted A/K/A Mini Trump does he learned from the Donald. And if you have not figured it out by now I could care less about Ted Cruz Mini Trump and could care less about Donald Trump. They are both two peas from the same pod. Get over it.

2016-04-07	Roland Sorenson - He can want all of it....and that is fine. But the honesty comes to an end it terms of actually getting it done. How does he plan on doing it?

Think he can even get dems to support him (you know, the same ones he isn't sure if he would support)?

Kinda hypocritical to both rail against the media, and then to use them to attack your opponent. Pick a lane, Bernie.|
2016-04-07	You know what's hypocritcal? Taking money from the gun lobby then accusing your opponent of favoring the NRA over children. Or how about taking millions of dollars from Wall Street and insisting you'll be toughest on reigning in the big banks. Or maybe taking several million dollars from the fossil fuel industry then promoting you're an advocate for the fight against climate change. The list goes on and on. Rant about Bernie all you want, but one of the last things he can be labled with is being a hypocrit.
2016-04-07	Oh come on, the Clinton campaign strategy that came out was "Disqualify Him, Defeat Him, Unify the party after".
2016-04-07	Clinton typically uses surrogates for the purposes of plausible deniability. If she didn't mean that, she'd tell David Brock et. al to "cut it out."
2016-04-07	He needs to shutup! If he doesn't want to be gossiped about. He is the one talking in front of the media. Their job is to spin and report.
2016-04-07	|These media outlets are owned by corps that are among HRC's biggest investors. You think its spin and report? Last month Kasich had more press and media time than Bernie; 25x the amount in fact. A guy that has won one state total in his own primary and struggles to break 15% in most states had 25x the amount of coverage.

That's not spin and report, its a hatchet job.|
2016-04-07	|He wasn't "gossiped about." He's referencing credible sources that have headlined him as "unqualified" and how they are going to "disqualify" him. He was reactive rather than proactive. If you want to victimize the aggressor, then that's on you.

2016-04-07	Gianpaolo Brasca, I saw that. Jeff Weaver whined that Hillary was smearing Bernie with innuendo and then ENGAGED IN INNUENDO about Hillary and Wall Street. Hillary is going to come back with the argument that by Bernie's standards, Obama and Kerry weren't qualified either.
2016-04-07	Cheryl Onstad By Bernie's calculations, if you do not agree with him 100%, if you do not march in lock-step with Bernie Sanders, you are somehow unqualified to be president. He's wrong, and this vanity campaign he's running is bad for Democrats. It is time for him to act like a Democrat and commit to helping down ballot Dems and thinking of more than his own ambitions.
2016-04-07	You mean like Bernie's motives to help the working and middle class? His motive to avoid war? His motive to extend health care to all Americans? His motive for people who work full time to not be in poverty? For college to be affordable? His motive to address climate change? Which motive of Bernie's is not good for the 99%? Can you name one?
2016-04-07	Hillary takes the high road whiile Bernie rolls around in the gutter.
2016-04-07	Her key qualification is to act in the sense of knowing exactly how things play. Unfortunatly familiarity breeds contempt and the longer she is exposed to her record she has more difficulty ignoring Bernie, reality, and her abilities to change course for the better.
2016-04-07	William Wilson This is nothing compared to what is going on in the GOP. I mean the Republicans literally hate both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz that they can taste it. Hillary just stated she would take Bernie over Trump or Cruz any day. This is just red meat to give the press fodder to make money.
2016-04-07	And why did Bernie Sanders say that about her? Because she implied that he was unfit to be president.Karma is hell.
2016-04-07	Hillary Clinton is a far classier person and candidate than that grumpy old man.
2016-04-07	Very classless position we see from more of the Hillary crowd.
2016-04-07	William Wilson Oh, the irony!
2016-04-07	Hugh Johnson Yet Bernie has been right on almost all key issues while Hillar was wrong and reckless. Facts and history are a strange thing in that you can't rewrite them later as Hillary tries.

2016-04-07	|"Don't make promises you don't keep, know what you want to achieve, and then bring everybody together to get the results,"

That is a very interesting shot at Sanders, but I have to agree. My #1 issue with Sanders is that there is no way he can deliver.
Obama tried free community college.
Obama tried single payer healhcare.
Hell, Obama nominated a moderate SC justice and the GOP won't even have a hearing.

How is Sanders going to get any of this plan through? Especially if he is wishy-washy on supporting down ballot democrats?

As far as Bernie over Cruz or Trump? Yes please.|
2016-04-07	I guess the republicans who you all claim have been after Hillary Clinton for years (there's even a book) are going to roll out the red carpet for her. Your ignorance is appalling
2016-04-07	|Obama never tried single payer health care.
Corporate Clintons gutted welfare, pushed prisons, and sent jobs off shore. Deliveables to be proud of. Youwant more of the same?|
2016-04-07	Nelson Frederick - No, of course they won't roll out the red carpet. But it will be easier to get the few remaining moderates on board along with ALL of the dems because HRC's agenda isn't nearly as far left and Bernie's is. Plus, Hillary will actually have the support of the dems. Bernie? I'm not so sure about.
2016-04-07	|Sanders truly crossed the line. He's been attacking her character and integrity for weeks. He reminds you of the kid that throws rocks, then hides his hands. He gave an awful interview, and when the media and Clinton call him out (he would have been all over it), he clearly is cracking under the pressure. Hillary is justified in highlighting the contrast between them. He also SHOULD be able to clearly answer questions that are asked of him. People aren't WRONG for pressing him on specifics.

GO HILLARY!|
2016-04-07	It's call telling the truth about your opponent in a race to secure a nomination, did you forget that? And people are not wrong for calling Hillary out on her lies.
2016-04-07	Nelson Frederick what lies? sanders is the one lying and you're believing the BS..shame.
2016-04-07	“I don’t believe that she is qualified if she is, through her super PAC, taking tens of millions of dollars in special-interest funds,” he said.
2016-04-07	Now that Cruz was able to wound Trump in Wisconsin, Kasich (the only one to lead the polls in the general electon), should be the obviuous choice.
2016-04-07	The Pollster still have Carson in the lead!
2016-04-07	Yep just like he can win Wisconsin. Just like he is surging in the polls in Pennsylvania into 3rd place when there is only three candidates running. Out of all the primaries and caucuses that have been held he has just won one. His home State. What is it about John Kasich that he sees in himself that nobody else sees.

Now they want to stop trump not to get enough delegates for open convention. Kasich is their agent hoping he will get to be president or he will be successful in stoping trump. RNC corruption . They don't like either trump or Cruz . Cuban priest and trump no establishment. Kasich is their choice even though he fails utterly. There are some irrational heads out there think he is nice guy it he is there to spoil and stop trump.
2016-04-07	Unfathomable. This guy is the best candidate and he gets no traction. American's love their comic book heros. Actual thinking bedamned.
2016-04-07	Best candidate? I personally don't like NAFTA, amnesty, boots on the ground in the Ukraine, and presidents pandering to Black Lives Matter, myself. I can go on...hes's basically Hillary Clinton; but then look who funds him (Soros).

2016-04-07	|Sanders is sounding more and more like the Republican candidates with his attacks on Hillary Clinton. Not every wealthy person is corrupt. Democrats (including HIllary) don't vote in lockstep with Republicans on behalf of corporations. They vote against each other.

2016-04-07	Matt Potter You are certainly right about one thing. Hillary is Republican-lite. Bernie is not anti business, unless that business is corrupt and screwing the american workers.
2016-04-07	Barb Campbell: Thanks for the link. It is hard to believe Bernie has not visited the GE Aviation plant in Vermont. It employs 1000 people with good paying jobs.

2016-04-07	Brian Fejer Sorry thank you for correcting me... Yo Fallon, we think Hillary should stop sucking some guys on wallstreet for money because it makes all of wallstreet look bad. People might think that when you receive money from people that make their living by doing investments and playing with other people's money that someday those same people that gave you money will want their investment back and ask for special favors... And ultimatly you will enforce the interrests of the people who gave you a lot of money over the good of those who gave you less. That's Politics... And so mister Fallon, could you look into that please instead of worrying about timeouts and stuff.
2016-04-07	Brian Fejer You forgot about the, "and enriched themselves while bankrupting everyone else's 401k plans and tanked the economy", part.
2016-04-07	What's wrong with Wall St? They run welfare programs like Food Stamps, Student Loans, Small Biz Loans, Pensions for Police and Firemen.....
2016-04-07	They need to take a time out? Sanders is right on the money. If you believe that selling your soul in order to achieve power is acceptable...then vote for Hillary. If you believe that putting your own ambition ahead of people's lives...then vote for Hillary. If you believe that it is perfectly acceptable to leave the US and its secrets open to foreign hacking because you live as if you are above the law...vote for Hillary. NOTHING she has done has been done to benefit the country as a whole...only herself and her sense of entltement to the WH. People talk abou the Republican Party imploding...but Hillary is well on her way to damaging the Democratic Party between risking completely losing any chance of unifying the party and the un-democratic super delegate vote.
2016-04-07	Hugh Johnson That sounds like a perfect example of projection.
2016-04-07	Oh please! Get real. Sanders is taking you all for a ride and taking the last bit of your money on false promises and unicorns. He is a lying old fart who thinks he is the messiah and he is leading his cult to the edge and trying to take America with it.
2016-04-07	If you think someone who has said that he has never run a negative campaign, and then does, is not selling their soul, you are mistaken. He signed on the dotted line when he chose to run as a Democrat as well. But I forgot, your messiah can do no wrong.
2016-04-07	Bernie has started to play very dirty, which is disappointing. I think all of this is related to his weak start in NY, with the Daily News interview. He is embarassed and wants to create diversions. Frankly, I think it will backfire on him because Hillary didn't say he was not qualified, and it is pretty funny to have a guy who has not been a Democrat feigning concern about the future of the Democratic party.
2016-04-07	|Sanders has caucused with the Democratic Party for twenty five years, the Daily News story has been debunked and Hillary has been saying that he was unqualified for the office since the very first debate.

If you have any interest in keeping a viable Democratic Party, it would be best for you to realize that insulting the intelligence of half of the Party and Democratic leaning Independents is not a good strategy for maintaining it.|
2016-04-07	Why would you think that Bernie is only pretending to be concerned about the Democrat Party? He may have been an Independent, but of the two main parties, he identifies most closely with Democrats.
2016-04-07	|Actually Kathy, Hillary did say he was not qualified to be president after the interview AND look at this tweet Hillary sent out just yesterday!!!
She is blaming him for the death of sandy hook children! That is absolutely disgusting politics!!
https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/717797172154998784

Don't be fooled into thinking Bernie is just lashing out randomly at her. He is only responding in kind to the kind of accusations she has made upon his campaign recently.|
2016-04-07	Hillary's campaignmanager should seek fault in his own team. DON'T BULLY BERNIE!
2016-04-07	No kidding what fault? They have a 200 pledged delegate lead whereas President Obama only had a 108 delegate lead at this exact time in 2008. Additionally he only had 20 more superdelegates than her wheras now Hillary has 430 more than Bernie. Seems to me like they are stomping ass by any concievable metric, but then again I am fond of using facts and logic and even reading things.
2016-04-07	Jeff Nordley and you feel that those super delegates that she bought before the race even started, some of whom are lobbyists is a good reason to support her?
2016-04-07	Hugh Johnson http://www.desmogblog.com/.../hillary-clinton-john...
2016-04-07	Get used to it. She is going to be the next U.S. Senator from California. I hope that Dildo or whatever his name is gets some jail time for his lying "expose".
2016-04-07	|I mean the evidence from his video is pretty clear cut. Wouldnt classify it as "lying". On the other hand its good due process he is being investigated as there is probably enough evidence for a case agaisnt him (And all whisleblowers).

I am really confused that the same people that give praise to Snowden are the first to call for this man's head. Didnt they legally violate the same type of laws that all whistleblowers do?|
2016-04-07	|Mitchell Moore The label of whistleblower is tpyically given to an employee who outs their employer. Snowden violated the law, should stop being Putin's puppet, and come home and face the music.

The PP video guy violated the law by falsifying government documents. He's not being charged for being a "whistleblower" and he didn't even reveal any illegal activity. He released highly edited videos that did not prove what he claimed to have proved. There have been mutliple investigations into those videos much of which have been lead by Republican officials and every single one has found that PP has violated no laws. However he has now been indicted in two different jurisdictions (TX and CA) for his actions.|
2016-04-07	|Mitchell Moore No. The difference here is that this Daleiden dude went into this whole thing trying to uncover something that wasn't there. Where Snowden went to work for the contractor not knowing there was going to be abuses and then was given top secret clearance and saw all the abuses and realized that these abuses violated the constitution (like everyone predicted the Patriot Act would do.) So he released the information so people wouldn't be blind about the Patriot Act.

Texas has actually filed charges against him for making fraudulent claims and fraudulent movies. From what I remember he does face jail time, so this is the reason why he was getting his home raided. You get indicted and are going to court, you get your house raided.|
2016-04-07	|Good luck with that...

When you get indicted for stuff, you tend to get your home raided.|
2016-04-07	so explain how an indictment in Houston Texas allows the California States Attorney General to conduct a raid on his property? If the search was requested by the state of Texas, it should be their deputies performing it. If it's a federal case, the feds should be there. But it's a Texas case and a Cali attorney general making the decision on how to move forward. Sorry, you don't get to just decide you have jurisdiction without any charges in your district and then use charges from half the country away to justify your actions.
2016-04-07	Grant Johannessen Not that facts mattter, but he used a fake California driver's license. BTW - did you attend the Trump school of law?
2016-04-07	Grant Johannessen If the search was done without a warrant, whatever was found cannot be used in any case. If there was a search warrant, then there was reason to search.
2016-04-07	I think the better question is why do these anti-choice groups support a man that has been indicted for crimes in Texas and Californai.
2016-04-07	It messes with the narrative. Even in this article the lie about the tapes.
2016-04-07	|Amon Amarth I find it sickening that you try and use the crazy person in Colo Springs as a Christian in an effort to diminish all Christians. The fact is the guy is nuts and no more represents Christians than the Liberal Unabomber Ted Kazinsky represents all liberals.

In fact, if you want to consider who does represent a Christian in the event, then look no further than the University of Colorado Police Officer taht ran INTO PP to help. He was by all reports a great Father and dedicated Christian who went into the clinic to HELP. Why is it you choose to overlook this truth and instead try and label all christains as whackos by a misguided association that simply isn't there.|

these Planned ParentHood tapes were thoroughly debunked as edited fruads, there is NO TRUTH to these outrageous claims and Planned Parenthood should sue these frauds from the Susan B Anthony List for slander and defamation for continuing to pass along proven lies.|

2016-04-07	|Democrats are going to be making the biggest mistake of all if they think they are somehow united. Sanders running as a Democrat has illustrated just how broken the Democratic party is and has been. Independents (the most coveted of all votes - the swing) are flocking to him and he is pulling Democrats his way as well.

If Democrats want to be united, they need to prevent independents from using their party. Otherwise, they need to accept the innevitable: parties change, evolve, and will always become something different.

Uniting for the sake of party is a distant second to actual progress.|
2016-04-07	Hugh Johnson, independent votes decide every national election. They account for over 40% of the population. You're not even close to being right.
2016-04-07	Hugh Johnson, articles full of guessing why independents vote one way or another instead of actual figures showing a majority of either Democrats or Republicans is proving my point for me. Thanks. Keep digging that hole.
2016-04-07	Hugh Johnson, there isn't a viable third party in any first past the post election system. Welcome to civics 101. First lesson: know how your own election system works.
2016-04-07	This is entirely the fault of Hillary and Wasserman-Schultz' money-corrupted DNC, for attempting to override voters and foist a coronation rather than respecting the democratic primary process.

He founded the firm in 1998 with his brother John, formerly chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, then counselor to President Barack Obama, Mr. Podesta is the very definition of a Democratic insider.

2016-04-07	What in the hell is this idiot talking about? Neither Cruz nor Kasich broke 50%. Perhaps, if Trump gets over 50% both Kasich and Cruz should drop out because he did what they couldn't. Not only did those two not break 50%, but polling wise, Trump's margin over them is even higher.
2016-04-07	Hank Marcus Read the article to understand what I am talking about before you post. “If he doesn’t get over 50 percent, he should probably consider dropping out, like everyone else has when they don’t win their home state in a dramatic fashion,” Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said in an interview with ABC News' Powerhouse Politics podcast. Did Kasich drop out???? Did Cruz??? THAT was my point. Just that this guy is an idiot and doesn't seem to check before he runs off at the mouth.
2016-04-07	Hank Marcus how many votes does Trump lead Cruz by? i forget
2016-04-07	Abraham DeLacey To date, there isn't a single candidate who has won a single primary by 50%...not one of them. To extrapolate...each has had more opposition than support from their own party.

2016-04-07	As an Upstate New Yorker, I completely understand Ted Cruz comments on New York values. New York is one of the most corrupt states run by Mafia politicians like Coomo, DeBlasio and the corrupt Democrats. New York is still the highest taxed and most regulated state in the country. Simply stated- New York values will destroy the United States.

2016-04-07	The story should be about how Bernie will strongly support her. He screwed up by saying she is not qualified and being wrong that she said the same. He should apologize and then lose New York with grace.

http://usuncut.com/.../bill-clinton-black-lives-matter.../

The former president, with zero evidence, bizarrely accuses the activists of supporting murderous gang members in a full-throated defense of his and Hillary's crime bill that decimated black American men.

***Most young Americans have NEVER seen this side of Bill Clinton, even during the worst of 2008. Clinton’s attack was essentially repeating the thoroughly debunked right-wing talking point of “black-on-black crime.”|
2016-04-07	Jonah Moriarty then they never cared about the issues they said they did.
2016-04-07	Some damage control here from Bernie. However, he has always claimed he would endorse and support Hillary. All these guys who claim 'I WONT VOTE FOR HER' are going to feel awfully stupid watching Sanders stump for her.
2016-04-07	He's said on TYT recently that he only supports her under certain conditions (that she agrees to adopt his platform). Otherwise she won't get the benefit of his voter base.
2016-04-07	Ami Huntley All the more reason why Sanders cannot be the Democratic nominee. He is not a team player. All his "plans" would require a Dem majority, yet he won't commit to raising money or campaiging for anyone but himself. He's used the Dem party for years, taking their money yet now that he's Mr. Big Cheese, he gives back nothing. He even took money from an HRC Super pac in 2007! He's a 30 year establishment politician, a hypocrite who actually believes his own hype. When faced with Cruz or Trump his supporters will have to do some soul searching I guess. Allowing a racist billionaire to take over the country doesn't seem to align with Sanders' message.
2016-04-07	Ami Huntley Whew, what doggone purists - she has to be all-the-way Socialist Workers Party, huh? That would cost more than any gain, then.
2016-04-07	Good for Bernie; he's fighting for us. Hillary's fighting for the 1%.
2016-04-07	|Bernie is sounding more like a Minnie Trump everyday. Just look at this quote, "he only attacked her because she attacked him first."

2016-04-07	|Good for Bernie. Hillary needs to stop crying- She and her team like to start things-up, and I guess with Bernie, they thought that he would just take it.

Somehow Hillary's team failed to remember that Bernie is a born and raised New Yorker and Hillary is a carpet bagger- we eat carpet baggers who start crap.

Hillary's team put out a press release stating that they were going to "disqualify" Bernie and unite the democrat party. And then Bernie knocked them all down like they were all bowling ball pins.

A New Yorker's Strike! Bravo Bernie!|
2016-04-07	I'm not a New Yorker and never been there, but I can look at Bernie and see NY written all over him. I loved when his campaign manager said they would show Hillary how a real New Yorker fights back.
2016-04-07	Please point to the "press release" that you're referencing.
2016-04-07	Dure Jonah, a Hillary un-named campaign source sure started it. Don't worry when Bernie fails you can always jump over and start supportin Trump. Both guys are playing the same game, Bernie has just been a little less obnoxious the Trump. You will fit right in with that group.
2016-04-07	Bernie was not responsible for the Sandy Hook deaths, but Hillary promoted the illegal wars that led to hundreds of thousands of deaths in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. HIllary is "qualified" just like Cheney is "qualified" - and they both qualify for war crimes trials in the Hague.
2016-04-07	You're just too stupid to try an educate.
2016-04-07	Mark McCarty, unlike the children at Sandy Hook, soldiers volunteered to go to Iraq. The comparison is ridiculous, particularly when you understand that it was the Bush admin which can was responsible for the conduct of the war.

2016-04-08	|"there are only roughly 41,000 registered Democrats in the entire state — Bernie's path to victory is through making sure college students come out to vote." - LOL That's the story of Bernie's ENTIRE campaign. A bunch of easily swayed impressionable college kids. The New York media has already taken a bite out of Sanders, those news sharks smell blood in the water. Bernie can't even answer questions about how he intends to fulfill his promises.

He can attack Hillary with LIES all he wants, Bernie is burnt toast come April 19th|
2016-04-08	She will be in jail before the CA primary
2016-04-08	That's right. Bernie fires up his naive college kid base with pie in the sky ideas like free tuition, universal healthcare, and closing down the banks on Wall St, but none of it is true, makes any sense, or is implementable in the real world. After NY it will be all over for socialist Sanders.
2016-04-08	Let the record show that bob considers most european countries to be outside the real world.
2016-04-08	Wyoming who? Wyoming is irrelevant. After NY and the majority of its 99 delegates are won by Hillary, it will be all over but the crying for socialist Sanders and his nasty hippies.
2016-04-08	|At least get the F'in delegate count right New York has 247 delegates up for grabs, sanders is starting to win the race, get over it.
All the polling is tilting in his favor, and that sometimes does not even include the independent vote, which he has
Hillary Supporters need to remember Super's do not make up their mins to July. If it looks like Sanders has a better chance at defeating the GOP, than HIll, they will swap to him.
Neither one of them is going to hit the target without the Super vote, so neither will quit before july|
2016-04-08	Wyoming has two senators. Billions in resorces and the most beautiful national park in the world. One of the last places on earth where you can find wild bison and wild wolves. Of course hill-bots like you think it's irrelevant. I'm sure most fake progressives do. That's why she will lose Wyoming and lose the nomination.
2016-04-08	Seaason Violi - you just bugging!! He will not win NY, we know whats happenin in our stoops!!
2016-04-08	|Wyoming is one of those 33 states where the state democratic party laundered super pac donations for Clinton in exchange for 10 percent going to super delegate campaign funds

There is nothing democratic about that or how Clinton operates. The problem she has is people who vot for Sanders actually LIKE HIM

Clintons are all about the Clintons. Voters finally found authenticity in Sanders and her surrogate goon strategy and tactics only piss them off|
2016-04-08	that explains her huge lead, doesn't it?
2016-04-08	Michael Tucker there is a nice summary on young turks. $26 Million
2016-04-08	Michael Tucker Low informed voters name recognition explain it. That is changing which explains her shrinking lead.
2016-04-08	probably a better title for this story would be...."Insiders: 90 percent predict HIJACKED GOP convention"
2016-04-08	These are the rules. The poorly educated are ruining this country with their ignorance.
2016-04-08	None of the candidates will reach the required majority, it must go to the convention. If your guy is not able to get the majority needed before the convention, he will compete with my guy at the convention. No hijacking involved.
2016-04-08	Kathy Jane Bullshit. If Rubio had Trumps number of delegates, he would be the GOP's guy like 4 months ago. This is why you people are hated. You always deny the truth. Yeah it is true that all bets are off if Trump does not get to 1237, but the fact is any other candidate would have been given the green light. You are totally full of it and obviously are pulling for one of the other losers.
2016-04-08	|Prediction: Kasich will team up with New Mexico governor Susana Martinez. The appeal of that ticket as a Hillary-killer will convince even Trump and Cruz delegates to go for it on a fourth or fifth ballot. Ted Cruz can walk away feeling good that no longer does everybody hate him. Donald Trump can walk away feeling good that everybody does hate him.

If the Democrats cared about winning, faced with a Kasich-Martinez ticket, they would ditch the corruption queen and nominate Bernie Sanders in Philadelphia. But since most of the Democratic delegates are paid Clinton cronies, they'll nominate Clinton anyway and go down to a humiliating defeat.|
2016-04-08	Not really likely at all. How did you dream up something about someone with less than 200 delegates winning the nomination?
2016-04-08	sadly, that does seem a likely outcome.
2016-04-08	|Donald Filiault because the number of delegates one has only matters leading up to the first ballot at the convention.

Geoff, I'm not familiar with Gov. Martinez, but you just peaked my interest. If she's even just slightly more to the right than Kasich on some social issues, then that's a knockout ticket. I'd love to see it, and then maybe seem some actual work get done in DC.|
2016-04-08	|Insiders: 153% predict Democratic victory in November

No need for country to panic|
2016-04-08	If Trump or Cruz are the nominee Hillary will win because the bulk of Republican won't vote for either of them. Myself included.

What does someone's politics have to do with the merit of a case? Idiot. It's a minor case, but you have no clue the definition of battery in Florida. You can't go grabbing anyone you want to because you don't like what they are doing and pull them aside. He did it forcefully enough btw to stop her. I think it is also funny he contributed to Hillarys campaign because the Donald has also contributed to her campaign in the past. Even Steven. Trumps rhetoric of "I wish I could punch them in the face" and "in the old days they would be taken out on a stretcher" finally materialized. You had the one supporter sucker punch the protestor. And now this. Just because you don't like what someone says doesn't give anyone the right to assault them. TRUMP = EGOTISTICAL, NARCISISTIC BULLY.

You see, it matters not HOW HARD Lewandowski pulled, it's that he pulled at all. It was neither his job nor in his best interest to even touch the reporter, it makes for and has made bad press.

2016-04-08	|Michael Iger you are idiot , he said he would much rather ppl pay up for their nato support, but if they dont pay up then they gotta defend themselves. then you start talking some nonsense to do with abortion, For which was a hyperthetical question. "if abortion was illegal , Then.."

saying stuff like bigot and racist is nothign but smears that have no basis in reality. Calling for deporting illegal immigrants does not make you a racist, Islam is not a race, its a religon. And its a fact that there are many unvetted muslims entering the country, especially from europe and syria. IF you want a president that gambles with the lifes of its ppl, go and vote for a 3rd obama term or the socialist who will bring USA into massive massive debt.|
2016-04-08	Michael Iger Trump said he would penalize "doctors" who abort not according to current government laws. HE DID NOT SAY HE WOULD PENALIZE WOMEN. THE MSM EDITED THAT PART OUT.
2016-04-08	Drumpf the first to use social media??? Did he forget how Obama raised more with ONLINE donations than any candidate when he first ran?? All of them are using social media.. Drumpf just retweets racist crap the most!
2016-04-08	Obama had a ground game. Trump only has Twitter. No one else has used social media any better than my mom.
2016-04-08	He didn't forget, he never knew it. He was so busy telling himself how wonderful he was he couldn't take in any thng that involved anybody else.

2016-04-08	How hard is it to figure out without needing an explanation? The campaign is constantly evolving and his time is better spent right now in NY, PA, CT,DE,RI now for the April 26 contests. California is still 2 months away on June 7th.
2016-04-08	Robert George then he shouldn't have made the commitment! It's not like this is the first time he's bailed on a comitted event. His time would be better spent filing bankrupticies to help fill his coffers with other people's money.
2016-04-08	Nobody cares what Wayne thinks. His name is Wayne.
2016-04-08	It will not come together. How does the Donald win a general election, forgetting the democrats that will vote against him, when 25 percent OR BETTER of us republicans will just stay home. Guys like Hannity and Limbaugh, whom I have a hard time listening to anymore, just do not get that and try to portray us conservatives as "establishment". Pretty simple for me, I am conservative and Trump is a liberal disguised in sheep's clothing. Not rocket science. Oh yeh, then there is the 70 percent negative rating, that will not change.
2016-04-08	Trump will energize the lazy voters once he is nominated.
2016-04-08	Wow! I'm a successful business woman and just got back from a Boston trade show and was connecting to more woman in business that loves trump and I'm talking very successful and some not so much..why is he the front runner then since last June? I think some of those polls saying that 70 percent unfavorable are just fabricated bullcrap..do you know what I know and I won't tell you how I know? Well he will be the republican nominee !
2016-04-08	Jack Zaccardi, and once 'energized' they will no longer be lazy voters and, hence, not Trump supporters, eh?
2016-04-08	He made his point. He'll move on. If she runs her mouth again, he'll return to it.
2016-04-08	Exactly! He made his point that he's a moron (anyone who takes offense at a headline, in the Washington Post, no less). Now, about that "immoral" GE. Since they're undermining the fabric of American society, Sanders would probably be happy to see them close their Vermont facility and move to a state that would appreciate those 1000+ jobs. Such a moron!

2016-04-08	Lou Kaye Of course not, but she can't even be honest that there is a criminal investigation ongoing. An investigation where someone has been given immunity.
2016-04-08	Carter Smith I don't think the investigation is a secret. And indeed, many from the FBI have gone on the record as saying this is NOT an investigation into Hillary Clinton, personally.
2016-04-08	|The numbers will may tighten, but it most likely won't matter. Sanders needs big wins, not tight losses (or even tight wins).

He's going to romp through Wyoming by 30, then lose NY by 6, and at the point, it will be the end (again). Sanders will say momentum on on his side based on where the polls said he was 3 months ago vs the results, and he will continue on.

My guess is he will lose the next block in a close one as well, and that should certify the end of the campaign (but he won't stop). He would be left in a position of needed to win Cali by +50 points, and that isn't going to happen.

Hopefully the race stays fairly friendly.|

I heard Chuck Todd say Wednesday morning that Sanders needs to win 67 percent of the remaining pledged delegates to overtake her lead. Since all delegates are awarded proportionally, and since there aren’t likely to be many huge blowouts in the upcoming states (we’re almost done with caucuses), that seems a tall order.

2016-04-08	In 2008, Hillary won both New York AND California. It wasn't enough to make up Obama's delegate advantage...and HIS delegate advantage was far less than Hillary's advantage over Bernie.
2016-04-08	if she continues to lose, or tie Sanders, she is damaged goods.... she needs to work to earn Sanders supporters if she wants to win the general. and by this I mean when she poivots, she pivots 360.
2016-04-08	|PJ Smith That's the Sanders fantasy. But, she will lead in delegates. She will lead in popular vote. And with Bernie refusing to fundraise for other Democrats in Congress, she will lead with Super delegates. Sorry.

And we're not going to BEG Bernie supporters to do the right thing, either. If they want to act like children and stay home or vote for Jill Stein, they will be solely responsible for electing Cruz or Trump. That's on your heads.|
2016-04-08	He doesn't need that many to prevent her from going into the convention without a win -- and that's even if she's not indicted or the FBI hasn't recommended indictment by then.

The coverage is so extensive that there is no chance for quoting out of context because we don't get little snippets, we get the whole thing. Again and again. And the only think more scary than Trump are the people who support him no matter what he says and does. That's the kind of hero worship that has done in democracies again and again over history.

2016-04-08	Wow, the photo of Trump for this article makes him look like a giant oomp-looma.
2016-04-08	Next time, he should use his sister, Dooneese, for all modeling gigs.........she does have bigger hands than him.........
2016-04-08	well I don't know the facts of the case but donald trump is a big fat racist - cuz she's like from jamaica an stuff, and he's a sexist cuz she's a woman, and he's a bigot....just because, maybe her lawyers can sue her back for frivilous lawsuit
2016-04-08	|I was surprised to hear somewhere in media (forgot where, but it was last week) that there's no indications that Trump has ever been a racist. I was floored since there's reams of circumstantial evidence that he is, evidence going as far back as 1973 when both Trumps (Donald and dad Fred) were sued by the U.S. DOJ for illegal race discrimination in their housing (rentals and sales).

The DOJ alleged:

The Trumps ordered sales and rental agents to do whatever was necessary to evict existing black and other minority tenants from rental pro...See More|
2016-04-08	Trump doesn't know what he believes in. Trump is only out for Trump and doesn't care about anyone else. Trump runs his big mouth and tells people what they want to here. His knowledge of real policy is close to zero. Just like punishing women for having an abortion and nuclear weapons to Japan and S. Korea. He just talks and runs his bigot mouth. Dump Trump
2016-04-08	i think you've hit it on the head: he believes in what's convenient at the time.

2016-04-08	consititutional conservative = ? Ruc does not know.
2016-04-08	What the hell does that even mean -- true constitutional conservative? Fear him more as a dominionist.
2016-04-08	The only problem with all of these rants by the author is Cruz has never once said he, as President would try to impose his will on the people. However, he has repeatedly said the PEOPLE, not the government or unelected judges should not be making decision about policy and people's lives. Cruz is a Constitutional Conservative which means he beleives the government should be limited to the powers granted to it by the words of the Constitutition, not the courts who have also went far beyond their role of intepreting the law to writing or rewriting it. Progressives cannot stand anyone who demands we go back to following the Constitution because it limits the powers of the Federal government which means they cannot use it and the courts to impose on the people those views and values they choose to reject.
2016-04-08	|"Constitutional Conservative which means he believes the government should be limited to the powers granted to it by the words of the Constitutition, not the courts who have also went far beyond their role of intepreting the law to writing or rewriting it,which means he believes the government should be limited to the powers granted to it by the words of the Constitutition, not the courts who have also went far beyond their role of intepreting the law to writing or rewriting it"?

PROVE IT! You cannot, so we see " Constitutional Conservative" = bald-faced liar and fool.|
2016-04-08	Are any of the "rants" untrue? Tell us how the Citizens United decision was constitutionally conservative. Where in the constitution does it say that free speech and money are really the same thing and deserve the same protection? If you don't like it here, move to Mexico...
2016-04-08	Bruce Tieman - Tell you what Bruce, if you think you are so informed and intelligent prove Frank Wrong.
2016-04-08	Conservatives are reactionary, as the topic shows. They create and contibute nothing. They only react in opposition to whatever comes along. This is because conservatives by definition "reist change", and, because of that, cannot lead. When a conservative is confronted by a fact that contradicts their opinon, they deny the fact, and are therefore dishonest.
2016-04-08	Prove it! Guess what, you cannot do it. Sucks to be you and called on by your own little petty game now doesn't it? You can try until you are blue in the face, but you cannot prove a word of what you just wrote. Keep in mind that opions are not fact and do not prove anything. So more of your worthless opinion is not needed.
2016-04-08	Todd Smith, I cannot prove a word of what I just wrote? Try a dictionary where it says "conservatives by definition 'reist change'". I doubt you have the intelligence to read a dictionary definition.
2016-04-08	|Bruce.. Surely you realize your description of conservatives is a perfect description of not just your post, but also of the other post on here that are bashing conservatives.
Others have attempted to answer or reply, however all you seem to know is bash and insult. I have to assume it makes you feel smart although you haven't contributed a single useful thought to the conversation.|
2016-04-08	Too conservative and just too crazy...a Dominionist who believes he is hand picked by "God" to be president and that government should be run according to the bible....HIS interpretation of the bible. We are a democracy, not a theocracy. This man is despised by every one of his peers, yet, he is the viable alternative to the Dumpster? Party before country when you belong to the GOP, I guess. A truly dangerous individual who will set the country back 100 years with his cuckoo religious views.
2016-04-08	Lol look at who your party is running moron, a communist called Sanders hahaha. And you have the audacity to attack a constitutionalist conservative? F U libby!
2016-04-08	Brian Kourdou WOW, what a mature, educated, informed response....proving the point that no one is so useless that they can't at least serve as a good example. Have a nice day.
2016-04-08	Brian Kourdou -- you just the type to love drumpf and cruzz.
2016-04-08	Of course Cruz is too conservative to be elected. The majority of American voters rejected conservative Republican candidates in both 2008 and 2012 and elected Obama twice. What is it that you don't get about where the majority of Americans are politically?
2016-04-08	|Because if Politico's writers wrote what they really felt - that Justin Bieber has a better chance of becoming Putin's Defense Minister than Cruz has in getting elected President - the Wingnuts would stop coming here

Ergo...........this tripe.

(Update: They changed the title from the moronic "Is Cruz Too Conservative To Be Elected)|
2016-04-08	actually Obama lost the popular vote the second time. and to add the rest of the story, Dems have lost close to 1000 seats nationwide since Obama took office. So.. what was that about the majority again?

2016-04-08	Nathan, so you hate Trump. Look at the choices we have, if you think good ol Ted would be better choice, think again. As for Hillary or Sanders you gotta be insane to vote for. (35 yrs Dem. first time Repu)

2016-04-08	Here, let me respond on Trump's behalf: "This is totally unfair. Yet another attempt to steal the election. Sad!"
2016-04-08	Because he and his campaign don't know what the hell they are doing it always becomes unfair in their heads, unfair when you turn your homework in late. What idiots.
2016-04-08	He's best for the job yet he's fighting everyone against him. Oddly he isn't canadian didn't marry his cousin or cheat on his wife or cheat many times over in this process yet he's the bad one? Oh my I worry about the future of this country more every day.

2016-04-08	Actually, the 2 BLM protesters were there for about 30 minutes quietly holding their signs when they were surrounded by several Hillary supporters telling them to drop there signs. It started to worsen as some started pushing them and trying to grab their signs. That's when they started yelling. Just a bit of context.
2016-04-08	Was that before or after they called his wife a murderer. Just a bit of context.
2016-04-08	Thanks Bradley, Is there a source for that?
2016-04-08	Clinton has nothing to apologize for in that matter... But just in that matter
2016-04-08	Oh it's OK woman abuser, of course the funny thing is that you clowns created The Obama Savage Movement.. Enjoy the irony..

2016-04-08	So will The Donald be entering Twee-hab to overcome this compulsion?
2016-04-08	ahh yes the liberal media clearly forcing trump to tweet...not like trump has had his foot permanetly planted in his mouth for 30 years
2016-04-08	lol
2016-04-08	|So much wrong with this story in regards to trump:

1. his advisors apparently have to babysit him so he doesn't say stupid shit on twitter or post quotes from fascist dictators

2. trump is so thin-skinned and unable to control his actions that all the media has to do is say something bad about him and they can get him to fly off the handle... great temperament for a president.

3. when ben carson is the reasonable voice in your corner, you know you're in bat shit crazy fantasy land|
2016-04-08	Why do we not want The Fourth Estate to have responsible Control over that man?
2016-04-08	The lame brain political drop out chimes in with more worthless tripe.
2016-04-08	Senator Barry Goldwater said this in 1994. " Mark my words if and when prechers get control of the GOP and they are sure trying to do so it is going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromies. But these Christians believe there are acting in the name of god so they won't compromise. I know I have tried to deal with them". This is about Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Sentaor Ted Cruz of Texas. Senator Goldwater saw the writing on the wall.
2016-04-08	On top of that a District Court found Governor Walker's right to work law unconstitutional. It is not over but you just can't fix stupid.
2016-04-08	Neal Levine He certainly did. My Dad was a big Goldwater fan for partially this reason. Don't you hate it when Dad is always right? LOL
2016-04-08	never mind those pesky voters of which Trump has 2M more of them than Cruz
2016-04-08	Rules are rules. Trump has never gotten the majority of votes in a primary and he won't ever get the support of the majority of delegates. Consequently, Trump will not be the republican nominee.
2016-04-08	Also has the highest DISapproval rating of the lot. There, I fixed it for you.
2016-04-08	dont worry if is go to second ballot only kachy will win the nomination. GOP hate cruz more than trump
2016-04-08	Cruz might do worse than Trump. Dude is WAY too far to the right for the general.
2016-04-08	I agree. Trump would get some crossover, even from Democrats. The Cruzifix, however, will make the Goldwater run look competitive. Plus, it will lay to rest, at long last, the Teabagger fantasy that the GOP's problem is that they keep nominating guys who aren't crazy...eh, conservative...enough. Crush Cruz...end the dream.
2016-04-08	Tell me something I don't know?
2016-04-08	As a registered conservative for over 40 years, and, mind you, a real registered conservative, a William Buckley conservative, it's not possible for Ted Cruz to be anything more than a mouth piece for the far right wing nuts and looney bins who have so greatly altered conservative values. He, and those who sponsor and/or endorse his campaign, fail to comprehend that to govern requires sane, sensible, and practical solutions to the problems that face our nation. God help us if he ever becomes more than just the junior senator from the lunacy-ridden state of Texas.
2016-04-08	You are not a real conservative if you think Ted Cruz is a "right wing nut". You are obviously a RINO.
2016-04-08	John B. Andelin A bagger definition of a RINO: Anyone who doesn't behave like a total asshole.
2016-04-08	John B. Andelin because he is right wing nut
2016-04-08	People in Glass houses should not throw stones. He say he is surging in the polls but always end in 3rd place. He says Ohio is doing great but not really. He says when he becomes emperor he will close teachers lounges because it is a hot bed of dissent. I thought he was running for President.

Kasich has lost about 32 times.......so that makes Kasich a loser.|
2016-04-08	Is that how you vote for president? Based on who others voted for? Who are you voting for, the person being investigated by the FBI or the vulgarian who wants everyone to have a nuclear weapon? Kasich has the most experience, a good record and is a moderate.

Lehman Brothers was forced to file for bankruptcy and was in such bad shape that it could not qualify for bailout funds.

2016-04-08	Looks like you know FIRST HAND about sociopath...looking at yourself in a mirror!
2016-04-08	The real psychopath is Sadam Hussein Obama with the evil demonic eyes.
2016-04-08	He definitely left himself some wiggle room with "if they piss me off one more time." Real profile in courage there, Levin.
2016-04-08	Seems Mark thinks so highly of himself that he thinks people involved in anything Trump need to comport to how he thinks the campaign should be run. Prove Stone got orders from Trump and I will prove Cruz gave the orders to his PAC about the Melania photo.
2016-04-08	Neil Burson Levin called on Trump to publicly denounce Stone for the comment about releasing the hotel room numbers of the delegates. Levin didn't say Trump was ordering Stone to do so.
2016-04-08	How many times has Trump threatened to leave the Rep. party if they dont treat me fairly? How many times has he threatened to sue the RNC. He keeps whining THATS NOT FAIR but he keep staying. Talk about wiggle room. The fact that he has neither left the Party or sued must mean he is being treated fairly so he should stop his whining.
2016-04-08	When rats jump ship, they're still rats.
2016-04-08	And the ship still sank like the piece of junk garbage scow it was.

2016-04-08	Mark Levin is being paid to bash Trump...https://theconservativetreehouse.com/.../the-paid-dc.../
2016-04-08	Don't have to be paid because many of us can't support a despicable man like Trump. You can read just about anything on the web, doesn't make it true.
2016-04-08	|Marie Specht What about him is "despicable", specifically--other than his challenging the entrenched political establishment?

Is it the jobs he's created? The people he's inspired with his aspirational, American Dream message and example? The private acts of charity? His business acumen?

I'm an American, not a socialist, so success isn't "despicable" to me.|
2016-04-08	Aaron Solomon How on earth can you be inspired by an orange clown who absolutely can't talk about anything except his 'fabulous' poll numbers. He's an embarrassment to our party - mostly because he is a democrat!! #nevertrump
2016-04-09	How does Bernie think releasing a list of delegates that is clearly almost 700 behind Hillary's total works to his benefit. It just reminds everyone how far behind he is. Bernie is getting bad advice.
2016-04-09	Cheryl Onstad. It matters because the superdelegates provide much of her lead. They will have the opportunity to choose at the convention.
2016-04-09	|Mark Allen Fisher That is true. But what Bernie's campaign is doing is hurting the Dem party that they say they're willing to unite at the end of this. First Bernie has to catch up in pledged delegates and that's not going to happen. THEN he could make the argument that he's their guy. Putting this out now, saying they plan for a fight at the convention is not good for anyone, including Bernie. It makes him look like the political opportunist he assures us he's not.

I suspect this is all Jeff Weaver, who is not doing Bernie any favors, and is behind many of Bernie's stumbles this week. It appears the Bernie campaign wants to win at all costs, November be damned.|
2016-04-09	Cheryl Onstad Why does Bernie have to catch up in pledged delegates? There are enough superdelegates to bridge a substantial gap if Hillary is seen as a candidate who would do poorly in the general.
2016-04-09	Stop lumping the delegate totals together, Politico. This is a ploy to make the gap seem wider. Report Hillary's pledged delegates. That would illustrate the increasingly strong probability that this will come down to undemocratic superdelegates.
2016-04-09	Mark Allen Fisher, in this case it was Bernie's campaign who spoke of both pledged and supers.
2016-04-09	Hugh Johnson They are not democratically selected. Yes, I understand the process.
2016-04-09	Hugh Johnson how are super delegates democratic, Hug??
2016-04-09	|Wyoming has a TOTAL of 14 delegates. Bernie could win them all and Hillary would still be 200 pledged delegates ahead of him.

He's been claiming "momentum" since New Hampshire. It didn't help him in Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, etc. etc..

Hillary has the majority of pledged delegates available to date, and will continue to have the majority at the end of the primaries. I'm not sure if Bernie is delusional or just really bad at math. Perhaps his campaign manager, Tad Devine, wants to keep this going as long as possible because of the big bucks he's getting out of it.|

2016-04-09	He's won the last 8 states in a row, thats the momentum he's talking about. He just picked up wins in Missouri and Nevada this week as well, both states that voted Hilary months ago. He now has won more contests than Hillary has after these two switches.
2016-04-09	|Pledged delegates Source AP (I've added unallocated Washington state pledged delegates):
Clinton: 1301
Sanders: 1107
Difference: 194

They still haven't properly allocated the Washington state delegates to the count, but I included them in my count as 71-30 hypothetically (Sanders won 71% of state vote). As of now the AP still reports Sanders having won 25 delegates and Clinton 9 out of 101 delegates.

Tonight: Wyoming 14 delegates

2016-04-09	If the liberals were half as good with their propaganda as the cons were, we wouldn't be in this position. Unfortunately, the cons can repeat lies over and over with a straight face. And their followers are stupid enough to believe them.
2016-04-09	Billy Weeder Incoherent. Read the article. We are in the mess we are in because of leftist lies. The democrat sheep elected a gobalist puppet twice. Obama's been in office for 7-8 years, hence the current mess. You unfortunately are ignorant when it comes to US politics. If the words don't add up its because truth wasn't included in the equation. Why do you think their conference is closed to the press? Just say NO to liberal lies!

2016-04-09	If Cruz is the nominee, you should write in Trump and vote straight ticket Democrat down the rest of the ticket, unless it's district 1 in wisconsin, in which case you should be voting for Ryan's primary challenger.

My real statement on this point however was that I am concerned about what the Democratic Party is becoming and doing. I'd really like to see some new parties. Or at least some candidates that don't just tow the party line (and are not insane).|

BTW...Trump has threatened to file such a suit...but, to date has not. If he really believed Cruz was ineligible, what is he waiting for?|

The GOP hasn't touched Obamacare, which is an economic disaster.

It must be stated that portraying Israel in ways similar to how Jews are portrayed in "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" absolutely is anti-Semitic.

Bernie's just flopping along now and already has lost the race. Make history with the felony con's choice, since their Tea-bagger controlled parole officer gives them no other choice. Even in a Bizzaro world of acid-takers for 60 years straight, B.S. Bernie would be the most cruel communist socialist dictator you could ever imagine. B.S. Bernie has HELTER SKELTER written all over his walls in his house, and tattoos on his wife too.
2016-04-10	GO GO GREAT Bernie !!

2016-04-10	Lets face it the Jews have been enslaved, tortured, and had genocide heaped upon them. Some times I think they go to far, then I remember these facts. Some time in this world you got to send a strong message, or others will take advantage of your weakness.
2016-04-10	|Sanders said that "to the extent that Israel wants a good relationship with us, they have to improve their relations with the Palestinians." That's like telling Iraq that if it wants a good relationship with us, it needs to improve its relationship with ISIS.
Don't forget, when the Gazans elected Hamas to power, Hamas then violently eliminated the domestic political opposition -- Fatah -- mass shooting its members and throwing them off of roofs. Hamas has the announced goals of murdering as many Jews as possible and replacing Israel with an Islamic theocracy.|

2016-04-10	|Scott Rose So, if I understand this correctly, when a terrorist group attacks a State or Nation, the correct answer is retaliation against the entire population this terrorist group hides amongst, the destruction of their houses, blockade of their trade and the construction of a wall beyond their borders.

End of the day, after this populace has no access to information, education, welfare and other basic needs, it is their fault when they vote into power those very representatives that say they are fighting for them.

Got it.

And then, if you dare critisize such action, you are bigoted against the practisioners of a religion.

2016-04-10	Bernie is not meeting with the Pope. He received an invitation to speak at a small, invitation-only scholarly conference at the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences conference celebrating the 25th year anniversary of an encyclical “Centesimus Annus,” written by Pope John Paul II on the evils of capitalism.
2016-04-10	I thought Bernie was going to attend an academic conference at the Vatican. The invitation was not from the Pope, but from the academic institition PASS. Are you sure that he is meeting with the Pope? I was surprised when he said he was leaving to attend this academic conference in the days before the New York primary.

What are they really trying to cover up?
I'm sending this to all my friends, family and patriot brothers......See More|
2016-04-10	Deivis Jaimes Trump pay you well for all that.
2016-04-10	if you have an "outy" you use the boys/mens room,......see how simple that is
2016-04-10	So you would be fine with Caitlin Jenner using the mens' room in your gym? Or do you just hate transgendered people in general (no fan of Jenner here. Just using her as an example ).
2016-04-10	Tom Fitzpatrick If she really wants to be a woman, she should complete her transformation. But the reason this law was written is because of a municipal law that would have permitted any man who just said he identified as a woman to enter a woman's bathroom. They could be wearing a man's suit and the law would have permitted them to do this. Sorry, but I am not that trusting of a person.
2016-04-10	Tom Fitzpatrick Yes. Especially since he used the men's room and the men's locker room all his life. I don't understand the problem with him continuing to use the men's restroom and locker room. Also, I believe he said he has no intention of having his parts removed, that he still likes his parts, so especially in that case I would say he needs to use the men's room.
2016-04-10	|I am not completely informed of what this law does or doesn't do ...
And as the father of two daughters, and the Grandfather of three girls
As well a human who is very aware of how male predators will use any
loophole to satisfy their perverted desires ...
Would not want a law that allows what was born male, to have any reason
to be in the same room where these children deserve complete privacy
If for the reason of fairness someone chooses to change what they are
Then build a third toilet for that group ...
Problem solved ... !|
2016-04-10	Amon Amarth Any dirty old man can claim to be transgendered and use the ladies room. How are you going to stop him? Do the transgendered need to be in a dress? Why? You can't tell people what to wear. Do they need a card from their psychologist or the government certifing that they are transgender? How Orwellian. So stop with the knee-jerk liberal reactions and listen to other people's objections.
2016-04-10	Jon Swanson Right now there are plenty of trans men out there that used to be women. They are big and muscular. They have beards. They sound, think and act like men. You want them in the bathroom with your little girls?
2016-04-10	Jon Swanson Who is going to do a genital and birth certificate check of every person in a bathroom?
2016-04-10	|Well said, Gov Kasich!!!!!!!
There will always be extremist and haters in this world, but it's our responsibility as moderate Republicans to take the reigns back and focus on matters such as building the economy, strengthening our global relationships and keeping America as the greatest nation in the world.|
2016-04-10	It is not about hate...it is about trust. It is not that transgender people shouldn't be permitted to use the restroom of choice...but the fact that you cannot determine who is and who is not truly transgender. THe law that spurred this legislation would have permitted a man who says he identifies as a woman to walk into a woman's restroom in a coat and tie. I for one would not stop to ask questions and assume that the man means to harm someone. Again, if you want to be a woman....go all the way. Until you no longer have that male appendage, it is hard to take your word.
2016-04-10	Amon Amarth What I think will happen in the end is we will remove all identities from restrooms and people will just have to go in and use a restroom.
2016-04-10	That's because you're a pathetic, spineless centrist cuck, Kasich. You're funded by George Soros to prevent Trump from earning his rightful spot as GOP nominee. No woman wants to see a man undressing in the bathroom with her, regardless of what the man refers to himself as! It's an absolute disgrace!
2016-04-10	Who's going to be in charge of the strip-searches in order to enact this law?
2016-04-10	Jane Sheppard The law should be: "if you're a biological man and you are caught in the women's restroom, you will be punished." end of story.
2016-04-10	Well said. There's a reason no one's voting for Kasich outside of Ohio.
2016-04-10	|this is the point in the war when the Nazis in Germany lose faith in the Fascists in Italy.

Pretty soon, we'll need Japan's Tojo to broker a truce|

Who's the only admitted SOCIALIST running and what party's nomination is he seeking? Bernie Sanders and the Democrat Party!!!!

2016-04-10	Wrong Dean Francis, it's because these delegates are being bullied and or will be paid off, if they learn to play on the Cruz's GOP Extablishment Goons...
2016-04-10	Terry Doe Nope. Dean Francis hit it exactly right.
2016-04-10	First there was Lying Donald. Then there was Sleazy Donald. Now we have Whinny Donald.
2016-04-10	|No, there has been only one Donald, and that is Donald J. Trump the future POTUS

Trump has already won, almost 2 Millions more voters than Slezy, Lyin' Teddy Cruz.
How did Cruz steal delegates when the people in Colorado haven't even caste their votes yet? Thievery, cheating and with a little help from the Evil Establishment.

The GOP and the Liberal/Progress Democrats are both a corrupt, cancerous dead weight on all American and their underbelly which two parties have recently exposed, need to be sliced open and the point released and the gutted underbelly disinfected under the brightest Sun light.

This is not going to end well!|
2016-04-10	|Terry Doe If this wasn't a racie for the most important person in the world the moronic thoughts of the brainless might be funny. But this is a race for the most important job.

And the best the sick racist in the repug party can come up with is either TrumpO the
Clown or Cruz. How sad and sick is that?|
2016-04-10	Terry Doe Stealing involves taking something belonging to someone else. Trump did not own these delegates ergo they could not be stolen. Influenced, sure but not stolen. Get a grip.
2016-04-10	There is no dignity, honor or integrity in the GOP race. So as the Seinfeld Soup Nazi would say . . . ."NO WHITEHOUSE FOR YOU!"
2016-04-10	Nazis were Socialists you DUMBFUCK, just like Bernie :-)

Nordenfeldt • 6 minutes ago

Hitler wasn't socialist. Ever. Not even remotely close. Nobody who had ever actually studied anything about the man, the movement or the party would ever be so asinine as to claim otherwise. Yes, Hitler occasionally talked the talk of the left in the early years to try and win people away from his main rival, the communist party, but that's all. His party, his platforms, his actions are the epitome of the extreme right.

And no actually, Nazi stands for NSDAP National Socialist German Worker's Party. And that name was not his idea, that was the na...See More|
2016-04-10	Trump aides should be well versed in Gestapo tactics. Der Drumpf keeps a copy of Hitlers speeches on his bedside table!
2016-04-10	You must be one of Soros' Sores and Cyprians or just an underling.
2016-04-10	I don't know that it is true that Trump keeps Hiler's speeches by his bed side. I do know that he quotes Mousillini in his speeches and admires him. There are still a lot of people in America who lost friends and relatives to Hitler and Mousillini that might just take umbridge to Trump's admiration for these two.

2016-04-10	Clayton Forrester With you, Clayton.
2016-04-10	Yes, we're so scared. I'll wager Trump shows up for the first debate with Hillary or Bernie, is thoroughly 'trumped,' and then refuses to do any more because he was 'treated poorly.' In other words, he'll refuse to let people see what a moron he is compared to any Democrat.
2016-04-10	If everyone and everything is stupid and dishonest but you, it's likely you are the stupid dishonest one.

2016-04-10	Roy Ellis -hands down trump
2016-04-10	|Roy Ellis - It's Trump in a landslide, even back in the 1980's Ed Koch referred to him as a huckster, and CHANGING the subject/person changes NOTHING about Trump. So what's the fucking point of dragging anyone else into this??? Trump is the subject of the article, so why bring someone else up? IT doesn't change the FACT that Trump is a lying fraud.

That's such a bullshit tactic to distract, typical bullshit from a TROLL!!|

Tim needs to wake up, and realize Jeb Bush, his boss lost the primary early and in a big way! Get over it! The voters have spoken! If you think your going to keep control of Congress without Mr.Trump your a fool! If you dont support Mr.Trump we will all vote democrat on the down ballet! You better wake up Tim, your making an ass out of yourself on national tv. Americans love Trump! He will Make America Great Again! Go! Trump! Go! Trump! 2016!

2016-04-11	Phil Gauthier Yes but she also gets more delegates even when she loses the vote in the state. I still remember all the Dems whining about Bush getting elected in 2000 even though he lost the popular vote.

That's why all Colorado delegates who supported Trump were denied entry to the convention, why a resolution was passed prohibiting votes from Trump, and why the Colorado GOP issued a tweet saying "We did it! #nevertrump".

Just a regular old convention, nothing to see here, right Reince?!

2016-04-11	This is the game of politics. It's not beanbag. If Trump wants to play politics he has to learn the rules. He can't impose his own rules.
2016-04-11	Maybe the same old rules are the reasons we have OBAMA. Change the f'ing rules so the ruling class is not favored. Change now or it ids the end of the GOP.
2016-04-11	Preston Wilkerson the old rules are republican rules. Obama won twice, you guys didn't. Get over it.

2016-04-11	|Yes, he is vindictive enough to throw the White House to the Democrats, and the Supreme Court with it, if he does not win the nomination.

He's such a spoiled brat that he thinks he thinks that all other candidates must have 1,237 delegates to win, but he should just be given the nomination even if he does not have 1,237.|
2016-04-11	|Next to himself, Trump worships the dollar above all -- he won't waste his money on a doomed 3rd party bid.
He'll make a bunch of threats and bluster then disappear back into Trumpland where he is even greater than Kim Johng El.|
2016-04-11	Poor Trump, didn't pay attention in class when they were explaining "how delegates are assigned" in Colorado back in August. You think this guy should be president??
2016-04-11	Still light years better than Cruz and Kasuck!
2016-04-11	|Richard Flay You should have enrolled in Trump University. The first lesson you learn is that Trump is a con man who cannot be trusted.

Of course you could also ask his first two wives ... who he promised in the presence of God ... til death do us part.|
2016-04-11	yes
2016-04-11	Reince Priebus, that is NOT okay. Not in the year 2016! I guess it will take a couple Republican rank and file voting boycotts to convince you that we are not going to tolerate candidates selected for us anymore.
2016-04-11	So Repubicans don't like the system of selecting delegates that has been going on for a while...let's see....you feels the rules should be changed to allow your favorite to win without actually winning under the rules that are in place...sounds like you feel you are entitled to something you didn't win!
2016-04-11	By all means, please feel free to stay home on election day.
2016-04-11	Linda Adinolfi Solecki that was well said.

2016-04-11	Not true at all. His Legal Arizona Workforce Act (LAWA) was held up by the Supreme Court in May 2011. The most important provisions of SB 1070 were held up by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2012. His Taxpayers and Citizens Protection Act in Alabama, which was basically a combination of LAWA and SB 1070, was mostly held up by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and backed up by the Supreme Court rulings mentioned above. His ordinance in Fremont, Nebraska was 75% upheld, including its most important provisions of requiring the use of E-Verify in Fremont. The bills he writes are legally sound. Where they have not been upheld (such as Hazleton, PA and Farmer's Branch, TX) are typically smaller localities which cannot afford to hire legal counsel to match the high priced litigators employed by the ACLU, LULAC, etc. Indeed, the Hazleton ruling in the 3rd Circuit seems to blatantly contradict the May 2011 Supreme Court ruling.

2016-04-11	Oh please! She said Obama wasn't qualified in '08! This BS "sexism" crap has to stop. If Clinton wants to be President then she has to curb the gender pandering and toughen up. She claims to be tough -- let's see it!
2016-04-11	Her experience has largely been making bad choices on big, important decisions. It's not so much that she doesn't meet the bar for some notion of qualified, but that Bernie meets that bar much better.
2016-04-11	So what? What else does he have? He won't go after her on those "damned emails" and won't attack her record as Secretary of State. Next week Bernie will lose in New York and in a big way. But, at least he can say he lost with class. And Hilliary needs to put on her big girl pantssuit and quit whinning about it. This is a cake walk compared to what she will face after the conventions.
2016-04-11	|That's true. On paper, she's experienced. Qualified. Like a good resume

Then you call the references and you realized she screwed up every job she ever had in the last 20 years. and you realize she's not qualified to be a Mayor of a two person town.|

2016-04-11	It is so sweet of her campaign to "worry" about the opposition. Concern-Trolling always entertains.
2016-04-11	She is trying to encourage her supporters to resist being intimidated by the relentless barrage of insults coming from the Sandernistas. Nothing wrong with that. After all, Sanders frequently says he is going to win the nomination (he isn't). But I would do the same thing in his shoes.

2016-04-11	|Hillary is so far ahead that she is no longer even talking about Sanders. She isn't even showing up in states before primaries because she has won so many states in a row now.

If she was worried that she would lose she would be doing press conferences every day, desperately doing photo ops in upcoming primary states, and trying to find wedge issuse to drive between her and Sanders.

She hasn't been doing any of that. She's been sitting on a beach in Florida for the last 3 months because she knows she is so far ahead that Sanders can't win.

2016-04-11	|Jesse Cooday And what did "Kyle" say when President Obama invoked Sandy Hook to attack the Do-Nothing Republican NRA asswipes? Or does "Kyle" only complain about extremist right wing votes/policies by Republicans -- but socialist gun nuts are okay with him?

Fact: Sanders caved to the gun lobby in Vermont. That shows that if "Bernie" was in the White House, he'd cave to the Military-Industrial Complex. You and "Kyle" are never-ending suckers!|
2016-04-11	Hillary is absolutely correct here. Bernie votes and talks like he's in the gun lobbies pockets.
2016-04-11	|Hillary doesn't support the violence against women act?

She doesn't support assault weapons bans?

She supports frivolus lawsuits?|
2016-04-11	Except Hillary is the one taking money from gun lobbies, but nice try. Oh and the fact check on Vermont supplying guns is completely false, but that doesn't seem to stop her from slandering and mud slinging. I am so tired of her lies and the people defending them.
2016-04-11	Tim Hoefling are you saying there aren't laws that says its against the law to attck women??
2016-04-11	|And the facts show that less than 1% of guns used in crimes in New York ove the past like 20 years have come from Vermont, so... (per capita..... talk about misleading statistics)

My position on gun control is very similar to Sanders'. Yes, we do need more regulation. Allowing people to sue gun sellers or manufactorers any time a gun is used in a crime is absurd (as the original bill that he didn't sign allowed). Allowing to sue based on specific facts, like manufacturers intentionally making it easy for their guns to get onto the black market, etc., yeah, that make sense.|
2016-04-11	|Exactly.

Clinton and her supporters are desperate. They are taking these votes out of context to trick gullible people into thinking that Sanders is some sort of gun nut.|
2016-04-11	Tim Hoefling Agree that Clinton is making a mountain out of a molehill on the gun issue, disagree that "Clinton and her supporters are desperate." Math is not inspiring, but it is what it is. Today's polls provide further evidence.
2016-04-11	|Tim Hoefling
Democracy requires an intelligent and educated public, which is why the right has dumbed down education, both in school and in public discourse and journalism. Rather than fighting that trend HRC, being of the rightwing persuasion, uses it to the max.|

2016-04-11	Alex Meyer You can vote for whoever you like. I root for Bernie. Americans have had a bad habit of doing a little bit of regime change and telling foreigners how to live. Which has turned into a unmitigated disaster for the Middle East and consequently, Europe. So I have a vested interest in promoting a peace and dialogue oriented candidate like Bernie in the White House. Furthermore I think it's about time the US joins the rest of the civilized world on so many issues.
2016-04-11	Alex Meyer Why don't you try to keep out of other countries leaderships then? Supporting a candidate that turned Lybia into a failed state, that toppled Central American democracies while the international community was against the coup, supports overtrowing Assad, but does not have any plan for stabilizing after that. Stop your warmongering and imperialist attitude and maybe all the other nations might feel more relaxe about whoever the Americans choose to be commander in chief of the only nation that use WMD's in a war and refuses to apologize for it.

Its not like the current rules weren't around for a while and everyone running should have taken the trouble to know them. This is what happens when you have instant experts giving opinions, ignorance is bliss as they say.
2016-04-11	I might have been inclined to agree that the process should be as democratic as possible, but current events suggest that the current process does a good job of showing what candidates actually pay attention to rules and hiring competent staff.

If they could elect several openly socialist governors, senators, etc., I could start to think they have a real chance. Where are they, Bernie?|
2016-04-11	|Why in the world should Sanders shut anything down?

He's got a message, he's got money, and he's got absolutely no reason to bow out in favor of Hillary. The same proportional allocation system that won't let him catch up also won't knock him out even if Hillary wins NY by 15 points.|

2016-04-11	Thanks to Kasich, Cruz got knocked off the Mich delegates to the rules committee. Cruz yes is working hard in the smoke filled rooms to steal delegates, but in the long run who knows.

2016-04-11	Ill say it again: regardless of what you think of his politics, Ryan has a bright political future ahead and certainly will be running in the future. Why on earth would he step in this s--t puddle now and be forever stained?

2016-04-11	|Why is Trump winning the American voters over after 30 years of D.C. security and economic disasters ?
Common sense: Fair trade deals, enhanced border security, safety and increased military self-defense and vet support.
http://www.usatoday.com/.../donald-trump.../82899566/
He means it when he says, "The people of the United States expect their president to make tough decisions that could require the use of enhanced interrogation and I will not disappoint them. I will do whatever it takes to protect and defend this nation and its people."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/.../border-patrol-agents.../
"The union representing 16,500 Border Patrol agents has endorsed businessman Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination."|
2016-04-11	14,400,000 Americans belong to Unions. 16,500 support Trump - big deal.
2016-04-11	|Trump isn't 'winning the American voters over'; he is supported by a small segment of Americans, especially the uneducated, ill-informed, and/or rabidly bigoted, many of whom can't even be called 'voters' because they never voted before. Even most of his family isn't registered to vote in the primary.

'Common sense' in complex matters you lack even a rudimentary understanding of is practically useless; a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and total ignorance infected by hubris is even worse. He has repeatedly displayed his mind-boggling cluelessness in economics, foreign affairs, military policy... and everything else except perhaps eminent domain, something that has been useful to him in his career as a sleazy real estate developer.

Donald Trump is a deranged narcissist who isn't even qualified to be elected head clown at a failing circus. Suggesting that he 'means what he says' is hilarious—a pathological liar, he takes positions all over the map before walking them back.|

2016-04-11	They fo have to earn the support of voter's in the general election. The parties are private organizations and permitted to choose their nominees however they wish. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that the concept of primaries even came about. For most of US history, party nominees were chosen by delegates at conventions and voters were not involved until the general election.

2016-04-12	|Bill O'Reilly is as ignorant as they come. I have heard Donald Trump make the claim before that 59% of African American youths are unemployed but have never presented any evidence to back up his claim, this man is known to create his own numbers to serve his own self interest, he needs to be called out for this.
Last year the Labour Statistics board presented these numbers The youth labor force participation rate was highest for whites, at 62.3 percent in July 2015. The rate was 56.4 percent for blacks, 44.6 percent for Asians, and 56.2 percent for Hispanics. The rate for blacks rose by 3.5 percentage points from the previous July, while the rates for whites, Asians, and Hispanics showed little or no change.

2016-04-12	Tony Prescott I'm not trying to taking any sides, not really a fan of any candidate, but just to clarify the statistics you quote above represent the "labor force participation rate". This represents the percentage of the total capable youth population that is actively seeking employment. The claim of 59% is likely being derived from the number of employed youths as a percentage of the total youth population in each demographic, however that number would be 55.3%, not 59%.

2016-04-12	Well Larry, I think Bernard has "sold his soul" to quote, unquote Jeff Weaver, his campaign manager in his attempt to gain the nomination. Bernard has said and done things that he said he'd never do and had never done. He has not remained true to his principles. Where are your tax returns Bernard? Just saying, where's the transparency?
2016-04-12	I really don't understand this call for tax returns. He's the least wealthy candidate on either side, even when the GOP had 15 candidates going, and he released 2014, which includes a decently large amount of debt, kinda like most Americans. What do you expect to find there, Macy's credit card?

"sold his soul"...... Do you mean like, being the policy face for the financial industry interests of this country the way Hillary is constantly changing everything about her to fit politics of today because she really has no scruples at all and only cares about her own power?|
2016-04-12	Bernie needs to get his wife to release those top secret tax returns. What is he hiding?
2016-04-12	release wall street transcripts
2016-04-12	Charles Hensley Yeah the Goldman Sachs transcripts seem much more pertinent than the tax returns from the least wealthy candidate to run this year. I'm honestly at a complete loss about what people expect to find in his tax returns, but it's quite obvious what we could find in those transcripts.
2016-04-12	What do you expect to find in Bernie Sander's financial statements?
2016-04-12	Happy he lives in England. We do not need one more socialist with crazy ideas where everything is free, free tuition, free healthcare, etc. Why bother interviewing this idiot? Why would anyone care what he thinks? CNN has hit the bottom once again.
2016-04-12	|well, free healthcare works over there, and in canada, and in denmark, and in sweden, and and and..... Many places university is free. I am still looking for the anarchy.... nope not seeing it..... still looking for the loss of freedom.....nope not seeing it.... still looking for failed states.....

2016-04-12	Bryan Davis I'm currently going to grad school in Canada, where tuition for residents is roughyl $2k per semester. What's crazy about that? Sure it's mostly funded by taxes, but poor people actually have the opportunity to go if they get the grades and choose to.
2016-04-12	Bryan Davis Define 'works'. Healthcare works here too. And nothing is free.
2016-04-12	So he's a real BenieBro!!
2016-04-12	He is a Bernard Brother.
2016-04-12	Comments like this plus the comments made by Donald Trump only deligitimizes the never Trump group and the process. Try to take the nomination away from someone who has the most delegates and where the process is believed to be biased in its selection for the GOP nominee will only set up a recipe for anger and hostility.
2016-04-12	The difference is Rand Paul understood that this is how the Party works. If you don't like the way it's done, don't be a member of the GOP or start another party.

2016-04-12	|Rigged does not mean illegal. It doesn't imply shadyness. It means arranged or built

Rigged:

Assemble and adjust (the equipment of a sailboat, aircraft, etc.) to make it ready for operation.
"most sails are kept ready rigged"
Set up (equipment or a device or structure), typically hastily or in makeshift fashion.
"he had rigged up a sort of tent"

Both sides rig their elections to keep outsiders out. Dems worse than most Rep states.|
2016-04-12	I'm fine with his interpretation. It is biased, always has been, and always will be. Trump stormed the GOP, should have known how to play the game, and now complains because they didn't roll out the welcome mat. He is trying to take their party, he should have read some history
2016-04-12	I think the Republicans are worse than the Dems..........both are making sure one candidate doesn't win, but the Republicans are right out there about it! Like the tweet about We did it No Trump..........then they took it down right away. This was in Colorado where no one voted, but Cruz got all the delegates.
2016-04-12	Diane Daneker In that state, yes it's worse for Reps. But overall, the Dems are the most corrupt.
2016-04-12	This process is no different than what happens in business organizations, entrenched management is slow to acknowledge new upstarts and that provides a certain continuity and risk averse behavior to the organization. Political parties are no different in that sense nor is our Electoral College system in Presidential elections. It doesn't mean things don't change, but those changes have to be around long enough not to be seem as a whim or a flight of fancy and based in reality. Trump is not based in reality by a long shot.
2016-04-12	Trump and Sanders, regardless of what you think of them, have exposed the system for what it is...a lie. Your vote, your interest, even your participation means nothing, and never did. A small pool of pre approved acceptable candidates were presented, and you were hoodwinked into believing you chose them, and chose rhe ultimate winner. It was, and is, a lie.
2016-04-12	Hank Marcus ...lol...at your picture...that is cute.
2016-04-12	Hank Marcus I dont support Trump, but it doesnt have to be a majority, only a plurality. 37% is a sight more than anyone else. Its irrelevant though, the people have never had a choice, just pre approved candidates served up by those with a vested interest in staying in power. Its like Thomas Jefferson said....there needs to be a revolution every generation.
2016-04-12	Hank Marcus You're a little obsessed with Trump. I think you're a little drawn to him. Or maybe a lot.

There is not a single analyst who can name a state that Romney lost that Cruz can win.
Kasich beats her in several of them, as does Trump. This is not my opinion; it is a
standard analysis.|
2016-04-12	The problem with Kasich is that he's a moderate in a party that has become conservative. It is not the party Kasich is longing for when moderate Republicans were the norm and conservatives the wingnuts on the right. What happened is Republicans have turned away from the future of an improving society and back to one where they the few get the benefits in spite of the fact that it doesn't work for most, if it ever did. So they sit in their relatively comfortable hovels and vote down the future for all. Kasich has a lot of minds to change.
2016-04-12	Actually, he just appears moderate. His policy positions and what he's done as Governor of Ohio aren't too far removed from Cruz and Trump. Kasich is just quieter and sneakier.
2016-04-12	Brian Crowder What he's saying is more moderate and since this is not their year its all moot.
2016-04-12	Brian Crowder You are absolutely correct. Governor Kasich is a neocon. Has been from the very beginning. He is a fake conservative. But this says so much about the GOP and what it is all about. The party has moved so far right that Governor Kasch seems like a moderate. But he is not

2016-04-12	In the chaos that is the current POTUS campaign some of us may have lost sight of who might step in in the event the POTUS can no longer function. To me, this is just as important as the POTUS candidate. Anyone want to hazard a guess as to who would VP for The Rump?? Anyone at all?

2016-04-12	When in reality, the real shills are members of the Clinton political franchise. The frauds are those running the DNC.

2016-04-12	Does anyone know which supoerdelagtes he has approached?
2016-04-12	The idea of superdelegates is ridiculous. Sanders should focus on pledged delegates alone.
2016-04-12	Why should he? Hillary didn't focus on pledged alone. She had hundreds of SDs in the bag before any primary was held.
2016-04-12	Prem Singh = spam
2016-04-12	Prem Singh You make no sense, kid.
2016-04-12	Maybe Clinton should flip some of his SD and see how that goes over in Sander's camp?
2016-04-12	Considering she has over 250 to his 38. I'm not sure that is possible. Plus dont forgot that most of these SD's put their vote for clinton 8 months ago before the Sanders campaign was even thought to be a viable option for the demacratic party. She has to worry about losing SD's because that's the only way it can go for her. And with the comments of her campaign I think they are starting to worry that he can swing their pledge to Sanders. Why else would you take this line of attack.

It is a fact that socialists do pretty much want a bigger share of other peoples money via government "share the wealth" schemes.

2016-04-12	yep
2016-04-12	Peter Jones Yes, among "likely Democratic voters" in New York (home to Wall Street) Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders 55% to 41% — but that doesn't include Independents. The Democrat's party rules keep millions of Independents out of the New York primary. Democrats, who oppose strict "Jim Crow" voting laws in the South, don't want Independents in the North and elsewhere to vote. Why is that? I always thought the Democrats believed that EVERYONE should have a right to vote...unless if you want to vote for someone that is not acceptable to the Democratic Party machine.
2016-04-12	Bud Meyers This has nothing to do with voting rights. It's about a political party choosing its nominee. The party can do that in any fashion it wants, and if in some states, the party decides that you must declare yourself a member of that party through registration or voting, then that is what you must to do participate in the decisionmaking. That does not at all infringe on anyone's right to vote.

2016-04-12	You mean 36-35 for Clinton, seeing as how she won the state. Not that it really matters. I'd hope that next Tuesday would put this to bed, but it's not like people are going to learn math between now and then.

He's made a careeer out of insulting everyone and viciously attacking women. Trump is irrationally impulsive, as his constant meaningless but mean spirited Tweets show.

Bill believes that we can make America work for everyone, because we are special and the greatest country in the world. While Trump no longer thinks and does not believe we are great, that is why he makes all his products in China, cuts corners to exploit the system and constantly pays the lowest taxes possible, at the detriment of struggling and hardworking Americans.|

2016-04-12	Though primary voters have largely dismissed candidates with long political resumes, they're also hungry for a candidate who can steer the nation's foreign policy and national security in a turbulent time.

2016-04-12	Patty Nolte , I understand the point you are trying to make, but the question is not for a regular reader. It is a bit more for the reporting news outlet. Superdelegates have not voted and "stating" support is not an official vote, it's speculation. Have a great day.
2016-04-12	Patty Nolte How can you count votes that haven't been cast yet?
2016-04-12	Politico, why not mention the fact that the party and Hill's camp KNEW about this for 5 WEEKS and they're just releasing this information now?
2016-04-12	I'm not sure if Hillary's camp knew that Bernie's camp didn't know. Do you know that for a fact?
2016-04-12	Mark Hendricks It's on the Denver Post's article. Pretty damning.
2016-04-12	Mark Hendricks Full Quote: "The error — first uncovered by The Denver Post — was shared with rival Hillary Clinton's campaign by party officials but kept from Sanders until the Post told his staff Monday night."
2016-04-12	The same almost certainly occurred in Wyoming. He was about to win two counties until a box full of Hillary votes came in.

2016-04-12	Wyoming Dems are super angry... see their FB page, this is the trick HRC uses, "surrogates" who no-show at the state convention.
2016-04-12	They should have told both camps. That just "looks" shady.
2016-04-12	It is shady.
2016-04-12	Daniel Warren Curtis Caucuses ARE shady. If one looks closely at any of the results, Bernie might have benefited from said "shadiness".

2016-04-12	Voting for someone just because of their gender or race is wrong.

I would gladly vote for a woman who's not riding the coattails of her ex-politician husband. A woman President will happen one day, but it's nothing to push for. The response to a candidate should be organic and not some phony guilt-laden politically correct B.S.

2016-04-12	3 different polls
2016-04-12	It's not a different article, its constantly revised and posted as updated with a different title. . Politico is as money of the sites of this nature are, trying to drive the clicks and comments. The more commentary and clicking, reposting = larger ad revenue. I understand everyone is offering a product, and here we are commenting and reading it, but news this is not.
2016-04-12	Why are you pro HRC? Do you want to pay for schools? Or you want pay for healthcare? Clinton is payed by lobbies who are interested in gaining money and they are not interested in people's equality
2016-04-12	Well, we shall see if the northern blacks are any less gullible than their southern brothers and sisters. SMH.
2016-04-12	I am afraid they might be. Not all of us though. I can't believe that it will be the black vote to put this person in the White House.
2016-04-12	I'd argue that people who believe that a candidate for president who says he'll get passed this Congress a single payer system, free college and the dismantling of all the major banks are the gullible ones.
2016-04-12	Michael EisenbergThe alternative is trying nothing, while starting some new wars?
2016-04-12	|As Luis Miller asserts, “in general, both people in employment and those in full-time education believe that people should be allowed to keep most of what they earn and that it is OK for those who work harder or who are more productive to earn more”. He went on to say, “When people become unemployed, our study indicates that they let go of this belief. They put a higher value on the redistribution of money, which, in social terms, would mean higher taxes on those earning more in order to fund increased public spending.”

She will readily agree to issuing the DL to ILLEGAL ALIENS and then go one step further than Bernie by proposing that the DeBlasio will order the city to buy a car for each ILLEGAL ALIEN family. Of course, the funds for such extravaganza will come from increasing the tax on the same old ONE PERCENTERS !!

How will Bernie respond to this new proposal ??

2016-04-12	Victor Soto You are wrong and they already have voted in past elections in various states and the liberals are trying to get them to vote even more. In fact in New Mexico, one politician recently admitted that she voted in an election in the state several years ago while she still was illegally in this country. So you can deny it all you want and call people names, Victor, but the Democraps are kissing the butts of the illegals to get their votes and keep the party in power and control in this country for many years to come.

2016-04-12	looks like hillary got her jollies when she embraced this lady .earl
2016-04-12	Undocumented immigrants are people who shouldn't be here to begin with. Democratic elected officials violate their oaths of office by looking the other way when these criminals break into our country illegally. They do so in the hopes that , if they can somehow make these criminals into citizens, they'll vote Democratic later on. They pander to these ILLEGALS by coming up with perks such as undocumented driver's licenses. They put their party above their country. That's just wrong.
2016-04-12	Actually it was geared towards undocumented immigrants from South, Central America and Mexico. The drivers licences were proposed as a way to make sure that immigrants who were not citizens would have documentation that specifically stated that, so that they could not vote in any elections. Undocumented immigrants were being used by the large corporations to work for below minimum wages, and the Republicans didn't want to do anything about that. The goal was to easily check, and keep an eye on who lived where, if they were working and not paying taxes, if they were being used by large corpo...See More

Kasich needs to at least surpass Rubio's delegate haul to be taken remotely seriously at that point.

2016-04-12	|Trump in 2000: "I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. With today’s internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record.”

2016-04-12	Trump will change his mind on the second amendment a dozen times by this speech in May. Trump probably doesn't know what the second amendment is. He is such a dumb#ss. #NeverTrump
2016-04-12	I think you should reevaluate your comment. Trump owns firearms and he was the only one who is not a politican who brought to light what is going on in our country. All the rest of the establishment talked a good talk and tried to walk the walk but were full of it. The Republicans let the illegal, Mulims, liar into office and I could mention who, but you should do your home work.
2016-04-12	So vote for Hillary Clinton who has said she would do away with our Second Amendment, and then she went to Pennsylvania and told a different story. If what you say is true, do you think he would be a Second term president. You should do a lot of reserach on the other canidates running for office. Donald Trump has brought forht many issues that other canidates hide behind.

2016-04-12	|Sara Brightman Flat out false. Bernie has been long on pie in the sky promises and short on policy detail. His performance with the NY Daily News was so horrendous, they have endorsed Hillary and said this about Bernie.....

" Subjected to meaningful scrutiny for the first time, the senator from Vermont proved utterly unprepared for the Oval Office while confirming that the central thrusts of his campaign are politically impossible.

Which, paradoxically, is good news, because some of the most prominent Sanderisms would likely wreak epic economic damage."

And that was one of the nicer comments.

2016-04-12	I think it might be a nasty one and the real loser will be whoever gets the nomination since the GOP will likely get good negative stuff on both candidates. Can't be helped I guess since Bernie will not go quietly and Hillary sure as hell ain't going to show any weakness or unwillingness to fight fire with fire. You just don't dare to rise above the crap fest especially since Dukakis famously made that mistake when he ran against Bush.

2016-04-12	its the most influetial website in washington and the leading driver of traffic to political articles on politico, the post, etc.
2016-04-12	Amon Amarth But wait, the computer says I've got mail!
2016-04-12	|Robert Hewitt true, but if you want a new start up that is trying to be a tad balanced try the socialnewswatch site. If you like drudge, you will probably like this more-

http://socialnewswatch.com/|
2016-04-12	Drudge is the gayest man on the internet. Nothing wrong with that, but people should know.
2016-04-12	He's not gay. He's just sick. He looks sick, too.
2016-04-12	Hank Marcus I don't want any of those guys in the bathroom with my children. Remember, white Christian men are the most likely child molesters. I wonder why?
2016-04-12	Since you are a liberal, why would you say that?
2016-04-12	Not one single article about 400 people of all different ideologies getting arrested at the Capitol. You can't hide the truth Politico, it always has a way of getting out.
2016-04-12	It is pathetic. I used to really like the website; and odd, real odd, as Drudge always protrayed himself as a libertarian. So it makes little sense why Trump would be his guy. But Fox also has become a Trumpkin network. And I think what's infuriating to many conservatives is the betrayal by "conservative" media like Fox News, Hannity, Limbaugh, who have shown themselves for who they really are, just people trying to entertain and make a buck while husting iced tea or pandering to Trumpkin viewers. The real conservatives are people like National Review's writers; Bill Kristol, George Will, David Brooks. Amazing, I used to loathe CNN but now I watch them more because at least they only have one Trump surrogate who identifies himself. O'Reilly and Hannity are just in the bag for Trump that network is his infomercial station, along with Drudge. I may tune in when it's official and Trump is dumped on the second or third ballot. That will be entertaining.
2016-04-12	Me too. I never thought of CNN as a news network, but Fox has become the Trump Hype Network.
2016-04-12	When cranky mad-at-the-world Sanders continually attacks President Clinton's record and bad-mouths his wife in that same regard, then yes, he should defend his record. While Bill Clinton was spending 8 years in the White House, Sanders was doing what he does best, and has been doing for decades. Absolutely nothing.
2016-04-12	Well, Bill actually spent some time being impeached too...turned an intern into a cigar humidor so some of it was not in the WH thank God.
2016-04-12	Mike - Better call your proctologist as your head is firmly lodged up Clinton's butt. Amazed you hold a sexual predator in such high esteem. Hope that EBT card is serving you well.
2016-04-12	"You will recall that Clinton won the presidency after running as a populist alternative to the aristocratic George H. W. Bush; almost immediately after being elected, however, he chose to make financial markets his number one constituency. To satisfy those markets, he made reducing the federal deficit his top priority; he cut capital-gains taxes; he deregulated the banking industry; he ensured that derivatives would face no government scrutiny; and he cheered for the bull market as though it were an achievement of the average citizen: “How can any American, of any station in life, not be proud of the financial markets we have built,” he said in 1997." - Thomas Frank, "Listen, Liberal"
2016-04-12	I had no use for this man while he was in office, and I have even less now. I figure his wife will do us even more damage.
2016-04-12	And we have no use for you haters. Damage?? What a load! Your mind in warped beyond repair.

2016-04-12	Scott Henricks What you call "idealism" is IDEAS. This country was founded on new and good IDEAS and that is what Hillary LACKS completely. She just steals Bernie Sanders' positions on issues and then claims she is the continuation of Obama's presidency. Does Hillary Clinton have one original IDEA of her own??
2016-04-12	David Kent -- that's nonsense.... The truth is that Hillary has no ideas of her own so she just steals everyone else's.
2016-04-12	Of course they did, 92% of the media votes democrat, and the well known hang around with the rich democratic establishment.
2016-04-12	92%? I would just love to see the data that supports your statement. I doubt that. NY is a solid blue fortress, Sanders really had little chance there
2016-04-12	|There has to be a reason why this is the case, no?
Is it perhaps because the majority of the electorate tends to vote Democrat & the media wants to appeal to the majority of their readers?
There certainly are equal numbers among the rich republican establishment for them to hang around with I would think.|

2016-04-12	Yes, because all you smart people know what democratic socialism is, which is why you were so proud to go to a public school, drive on the roads we have, rely on firemen to protect you and your home from fire, police to catch someone who robs your home - because surely you know all these are socialist programs and exactly the kind of democratic socialism that Bernie talks about, which after all is as American as apple pie.

2016-04-12	Sandrine Burn Do you understand that most of the American Public doesn't see it that way, right or wrong? It's not that Democratic Socialism is wrong, far from it. It's that in today's political climate, saying that you're a socialist on camera makes you unelectable. Same with saying you're going to raise everyone's taxes. It's why the Republicans have taken aim at Hillary but left Sanders alone, because if he wins, then you'll see wall to wall ads using Sanders own words against him. Sanders is a liability and the only shot that the Republicans have to win the election.

And, of course, jokes depend on context. It helps when the person telling the joke is doing so openly, teasingly, happens to be married to a black person and is known for a civil right agenda. As opposed to a party that can only grow by attracting the poorly educated into an ethnically charged agenda (just like the southern Democrats of yore).|

Embracing Trump makes them look really bad and it'll make holding the Senate much harder for them.|
2016-04-12	He hasn't got over 50% mainly because of the crowded field of candidates until fairly recently.
2016-04-12	|Jamie Berry True, to a certain extent, except that Cruz and Kasich have picked up nearly 85% of the votes from Rubio and the other candidates that dropped out.

There is serious resistance to Trump, that's simply a fact. It'll be interesting to see if New York and the other Northeastern states like Maryland really buck that trend and embrace Trump so strongly - beyond the 35% or 40% Trump zealots.|
2016-04-12	How long has this idiot lived in NY and not been registered to vote? I only lived there for 4 years and registered within a month of moving there.
2016-04-12	She is clearly registered to vote. Over 40% of Americans are not registered with either party. In New York, the deadline to change party affiliation was October 9th, and the deadline to register to vote for the first time was the end of March. No other state has a similar gap, so Ivanka Trump is 100% correct to say New York is particularly bad with allowing Independents to vote in primaries. The real issue here is with closed primaries that disenfranchise a huge number of Americans who are forced to participate in the corrupt two party system.

2016-04-12	Tom Planamento How is excluding people who are not members of the party "disenfranchising"? Primaries are not in the constitution, they are creatures created by political parties, who have a complete right to designate who the party will support in the general election. Why should democrats have a nominating process open to republicans who can intentionally vote for someone they think has a weaker chance in the general election? People who complain that primaries aren't "democratic" are idiots. Political parties are not democracies, they are private membership associations. Party leaders can create a rule that says whoever catches the most pigeons will be the nominee. If you don't like it, don't join the party.
2016-04-12	I guess they've had no interest in voting until it benefits to them.

2016-04-12	Read the article. Registered to vote as an independent. Not difficult.
2016-04-12	Danny Ross Then why doesn't she have this sorted out? Not difficult.
2016-04-12	|I thought she was supposed to be the smart, successful one? Are you telling me all of his kids are idiots?

Nature over nurture :(|
2016-04-12	lol - They're very smart, believe them.
2016-04-12	Lisa Mona thats right just ask all his overpriveleged kids lol
2016-04-12	I'm a liberal but in todays day and age of digital records there is no reason to have a months long gap to change your party affiliaction or to register to vote. All states should have same day registerstration.
2016-04-12	I'd slam Ivanka ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2016-04-12	Her dad also would like to.
2016-04-12	Richard Joseph You have the Trumps confused with the Clintons.
2016-04-12	Sam Alecto oh no, it's definitely the Doh-nald
2016-04-12	I'm not a politician, but as a resdent of New York State, I KNOW what the rules are about voter registration. She's as clueless as her father. What a bunch. And the lowlifes who support donald actually believe this billionaire cares about them! hahahahahahahaha
2016-04-12	He and his brood wouldn't last a week in the America that 99.9% of us reside in.
2016-04-12	The bit where Eric spouts off about how amazing it is and how much work they did on voter reg. It's about as unselfaware a statement as I could imagine.
2016-04-12	|She's probably not clueless like her father has been in this campaign.

I know a few businessmen, and their natural instinct on politics is to register and stay independent to keep their options open.

That's pragmatic and all, but it goes to show how the Trump family has and still has absolutely zero loyalty to the Republican Party or conservatism.|
