2016-04-12	So let's review things he thought were good ideas, repeal Glass Stegal - great recession, NAFTA, NK deal. Sorry Bill but your legacy of failure you have no cred.
2016-04-12	@Anthony Prime, 23M Jobs, only budget surplus in our lifetimes, no major wars are a legacy of failure? Oh and what of note has you Uncle Bernie ever achieved to match??? Shameful
2016-04-12	|Mwema Kerich - Like all Presidents, often too much blame and too much credit are assigned to Presidents. Giving Bill credit for a budget surplus is a huge stretch because it would not have existed with the budget proposals he submitted to Congress so some credit for the questionable budget surplus does belong with Congress. Anthony seems to be suggesting Glass Stegal and the fact it was repealed under Bill Clinton as a major factor contributing to or causing the great rececssion which I am guessing was the global financial meltdown at the end of the Bush era.

While the repeal of Glass Steaga...See More|

2016-04-12	I'm sad President Clinton, after 8 years in office, doesn't see any danger in allowing folks with the potential to kill me and mine - because of their belief system - unfettered access to our country. I'm a live and let live kind of guy. For example, I stop for gopher turtles (common here in central FL). I also brake for squirrles. And while mowing, I stop and wait for a snake to slither out of the path. However, when wasps build a nest by my front door I don't dither.

2016-04-12	Sure Bill. Muslims have been so good for the country so far. All one has to do is look to Dearborn and Minneapolis to see how much they have helped. They were also great in the deconstruction of the World Trade Centers. And the Mosques they build are great when it comes to recruiting and training more bombers. Shut up and go away and take your dumbass wife with you.
2016-04-12	|That syphilis has finally come home to roost..

A new ICM poll has discovered two out of three Muslims in Britain would not give the government any information if they knew details about a terror plot.|
2016-04-12	|Any serious student of history should be seriously suspicious of allowing mass Muslim migration into this country.

From the beginnings of Islam until today, they have an unfortunate tendency towards jihad. They destroyed Western Roman civilization in the Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey. And sadly, Islam has never undergone the Reformation that Christianity did in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Importing a bunch of Muslims from Muslim countries is simply not a good idea. I'm sorry, political correctness fails here because far too many practitioners of Islam simply refuse to accept Western liberal values. You can't grant tolerance to the intolerant, and if the Democratic Party doesn't recognize that, it should be disavowed.|

The Senate refuses to do their Constitutional duty of advice and consent to make the Supreme Court of the US functional.

2016-04-13	The betting houses had their odds on that since the beginning.
2016-04-13	I don't think Trump will get enough delegates to secure the nomination before the convention. There's little chance he'd be the GOP nominee in a brokered convention, despite him being ahead both in delegate count and popular vote.
2016-04-13	Ignacio Martín I think you are wrong. If he doesn't get to the magic number, I would expect that some deal making will be going on behind the scenes. If he gets 1,100 or more, my bet is that there will be a deal with Kasich or Rubio to release their delegates to Trump.
2016-04-13	what happened to that Cruzmentum we heard so much about
2016-04-13	Bernie needs to win 57 percent of the outstanding votes to overtake Hillary in the pledged delegate race. That is just impossible considering that more or less half of the Democratic voters in NY, CA, PA, MD, DE, CT, NJ and NM are blacks and Latinos. Exit polls have shown that Hillary enjoys the consistent solid support from these minority groups. Bernie would have a hard time winning those states let alone get 57% of the votes or win by a 14-point margin. Moreover, these states have closed primaries which means that independents cannot vote and Bernie can't rely on them to earn a huge victory.
2016-04-13	|It really amazes me that in every single article Politco STILL lists the superdelegates in Clintons totals as if they have already voted.

Its been posted at least a dozen times that they need to stop doing this. It is an obvious attempt to suppress Bernie Sanders voters by making it seem that Clintons lead is insurmountable. Not a single superdelegate has voted yet and including their voted in the totals is an intentional deception by the Politco writers.

2016-04-13	Bernie Bros wishing the Superdelegates away doesn't actually make them go away. They're delegates that are supporting Clinton. Clinton currently leads the race by 2.5 million votes. The superdelegates pledged to Clinton aren't going anywhere.
2016-04-13	We won't be having a contested convention. Bernie is psycho and thinks he can rewrite the rules. Go back to Vermont.

2016-04-13	Wow, Lauren Brown, your're such a "democrat".
2016-04-13	|Rewriting rules? Sounds more like Hillary Clinton's attempt to make democrats less honest, more open to pandering, less worried about what's moral or ethical, and more prone to switching a position when it doesn't win votes.

Bernie has 50+ years of consistency on the issues. Hillary started off as a young conservative who worked hard for Goldwater and was against gay marriage until 2013. I want to know what my President plans to do with our country and there is no conceivable way to know which position Secretary Clinton will take once she holds the highest position in this nation. Bernie is consistent and trustworthy. Any candidate who can sweep their state in the primaries tells me everything I need to know about the job they've been doing.|
2016-04-13	please remove the superdelegates from the graphic
2016-04-13	O.k. We'll remove the superdelegates. Clinton currently leads Sanders without superdelegates by twice as many delegates as Obama ever led Clinton in 2012. Time to say night-night, Bernie Bros!

2016-04-13	|Dem primariy process not rigged?

City votes have less value than rural votes - favoring the more conservative leaning-republican voters - and working against the majority of voters, who are more liberal, by the way.

Rural votes have less value than super delegate votes.

Primaries were front-loaded to favor Hillary.

There was a universal "Bernie Blackout" until the surprise in Iowa. Because of that blackout, people in NY didn't even know that Bernie was running for president. If you didn't register AS A DEM before the OCTOBER deadline (six months before), you can't vote in this week's pri...See More|

Good God you people stop blaming everyone else for Bernie's and Berniebros lacking.|
2016-04-13	Roy Carl I didn't know that Bernie was running until January of this year. That's because of the DNC's "Bernie Blackout". Bernnie's base is independents who have to register as Democrats to vote for him. This also makes it imposibble for another of Bernie's bases (millenials) to vote for him even if they're Dems.
2016-04-13	Gail Newman You didn't know Bernie was running until January of this year because you're an idiot. Either that or you've been escaping from a locked box as part of a magic trick somewhere.
2016-04-13	The DNC is just as crooked as the RNC..Theyre both rigging the election to elect their insider candidate..Something needs to change folks
2016-04-13	Yes, imagine that. The DNC is set up so that it doesn't get taken hostage by some fire-breathing populist who, by his own admission, is only running in the Democratic primary so that he can make use of DNC machinery.

2016-04-13	The press needs to step back and take a deep breath instead of trying to control the message of who will be the the person selected as VP for the Democrats. You already have enough to write about the Republicans and you already tried to stir the pot with the Democrats with that Washington Post article about the qualified as President aricle that was never said nor true. Just to let you know, the public which has grown tired of your antics are now getting pretty pissed. Some advice. Pour a glass of wine. Smell the aroma and do your job instead of creating the news.

2016-04-13	|All VP candidates will have to contribute to the Clinton "Foundation" for their
names to be considered. The amount of the contribution will be taken into consideration
of course. But personal attributes will not be ignored altogether. Good luck men. (And it
will be a man.)|
2016-04-13	It was nice of him to acknowledge the service to Virginia of Republican John Warner. He certainly isn't the only Dem who appreciated Warner's ability to reach across the aisle to get things done; to encourage progress.
2016-04-13	Bernie supporters = Trump supporters. Same tactics. The candidates bear some responsibility for this. They are both promoting this nonsense with heated rhetoric.
2016-04-13	in that both supporters are against 1%....but trump supporters = racism/anti- education/climate change...
2016-04-13	Sara Brightman Their politics might be on two ends of the spectrum but their tactics are not. THAT is the point.
2016-04-13	|Lou Kaye
Why care what's in them? It's none of our business.|
2016-04-13	More of the Sanders trademark bullying. Where are those tax returns Bernie? What are you hiding? The people want to know.
2016-04-13	Jane Sanders cannot seem to find hers and Bernie's tax returns. Just like she could not find the time to keep the universityi she Presidented from going into bankruptcy....
2016-04-13	Lou Kaye Sanders won't release them. They show a huge amount of income. Just start: with $176,000 salary, for which he has done nothing for ONE year; with $46,000 in Social Security benefits. How much has the campaign paid Jane Sanders for standing there and doing nothing. How much has he reported for capital gains? How much has he reported for rental properties income? How much from his huge US Government retirement package that you paid for? It is a very, very large income. They are multi-millionaires but try to plead poverty - that they are just like you. Ha!!! Has he reported her $200,000 package that Burlington College paid her to get the hell out? She took the college to the brink of bankruptcy. So, until many more people bark, like he does, about not releasing his taxes, we will never see them.
2016-04-13	I'm curious...what do you think he is hiding? He is the poorest member of Congress. Why the Hail Mary play?
2016-04-13	The delegates are big boys and girls. Pretending they are being "bullied" is nonsense.
2016-04-13	|Totally agree, and am surprised that this is something MoveOn wants to take on.
The super delegate "scheme" was created following George McGovern's big loss in 1972. The idea was these party regular-party elites could stop an insurgent candidate that the mainstream party did not endorse. In that Bernie continues to win primaries/caucuses yet gets fewer delegates than Clinton in doing so shows you the plan is working just fine.

Between the super delegate House of Lords scheme, the fact that 33 state Dem committees started working "for" Clinton as of August 2015 (before a single vote could be cast) proves this was never going to be allowed to be anything but a coronation. Do you think it's just a coincidence that Sanders and O'Malley were the only competition? Everyone else saw immediately that the game was rigged, and the fix was in.|
2016-04-13	|Winston Herzog
Faux Democracy. The poobahs rigged it. The unwashed enjoy the appearance of a
say without actual input. One maintains ones power as one keeps the masses happy.
Putin does the same thing. The masses may chose from a pre-selected listing of
approved candidates.|
2016-04-13	Why can't they do it respectfully? Is it really that hard to politely ask them to change their vote? One superdelegate was called a bitch. This really hurts Sanders. He loses supporters or potential supporters because of these idiots. I wouldn't judge him for it because he doesn't have control over them but then again, he needs to publicly tell them to stop and he hasn't.
2016-04-13	Bernie is Desperate. Witness: Sanders campaign is currently characterizing any Clinton SuperDelegate as Corrupt. That makes about as much sense as Bernie trying to characterize Hillary as "unqualified" simply because she disagrees with him....
2016-04-13	|of course sanders is desperate....you would be desperate if the game was "rigged" with wall street/hedge fund
super delegates against you!|
2016-04-13	They are not against him, they support the party. He has railed against super delegates and the party. Meanwhile she has done fundraising in every state for state parties and down ticket candidates. She's so far ahead, she won't need them. He does. Rather than wooing, he's gone with harassing. Classy.
2016-04-13	Maybe, Amy Carson but he would be smarter to stick to the issues. Going negative seems like the wrong strategy. Tell me what you'll do for me (besides breaking up the banks) and I'll respond. Drag that other candidate through the mud and I'm turned off.
2016-04-13	|Penny White "Meanwhile she has bribed party officials in every state for state parties and down ticket candidates"

Fixed that for you.|
2016-04-13	Why not? Some will; some won't.
2016-04-13	|Because George......it smacks of McCarthy like tactics. Either you trust the process (and take the time to LEARN it ) or you don't.

That is what IMHO makes Trump crying about the delagate process a very bad joke......that man has looked at being President sincee 2000 and you are telling me a man with his business sense can't hire folks who KNOW the rules. IF anyone came to me no matter the party and asked me to sign such a thing "voluntary" or not (and the way Roger Stone is acting you KNOW it wouldn't be voluntary) I would tell them to go away.

The same thing with the Bernie supporters going after superdelagates - welcome to the process. You sdon't have to like it but you have to deal with it.|
2016-04-13	|Nazi pledge to Hitler.

Hugo Chavez had those.|
2016-04-13	|Roland Miller Thank you!! I've been saying this all week...if Bernie didn't like the process of the Democratic Party, maybe he should have not pretended to be one to try to get the nomination. He is running for his Senate seat as an Independent again.
Same with Trump. The process will not be changed because some millionaire throws a hissy fit and threatens violence. In fact, both those things should disqualify the man.|
2016-04-13	"four days of NON VIOLENT demonstrations"" Yes - from Trump supporters. This should go well...
2016-04-13	So the one guy who first was opposed to signing the loyalty pledge, is now asking his delegates to sign a loyalty pledge.............................Priceless!

2016-04-13	and then cool your heels on ice
2016-04-13	What is it with Trump and loyalty pledges and oaths? It smacks of something not seen in American politics? Delegates have always had their conscience and character to do the right thing which was good enough until Trump came along.
2016-04-13	This is communist and third reich country. It also circumvents the rules of each state which govern loyalty.
2016-04-13	But it HAS been seen..Inauguration Day 2009. Unelected lobbyist Grover Norquist meets with a bunch of top level GOP Congressmen and gets them to sign a pledge that they will never vote yes on anything Obama proposes. And let us not forget Tehran Tom and his signed by 47 members letter to Iran warning them not to trust the USA. The GOP has sold themselves to Satan. Trump is the personification of what they have become.
2016-04-13	Susan Gessford I think this is unusal in that its for a political convention where the pledge is to elect a candidate and not just an issue. You can't know what is going to happen at the convention to change one's opinion of that candidate, he could go off the rails. He's already said some pretty outrageous things.
2016-04-13	Nothing is stacked. The Colorado process has been in place since the mid 1990's. It's Rump's tough luck that he didn't check this out.
2016-04-13	It wasn't tough luck.. it was his arrogance and ego that caused this...
2016-04-13	What sounds dishonest to me was the fact that Trump delegates were replaced. Like the gentleman who burned his republican papers on youtube. He said he was a delegate and they deliberately replaced him because he was a Trump voter. Then the tweet that took place and was quickly removed. Sorry, but I am far from naive!!
2016-04-13	Linda Crimeni Duncan NO, acutally you ARE Niave! You dont think Little Donnie is behind all these games? Come on, you are being played like a violin. Trump owns the media, let alone uses it. Media manipulation at its finest and most dangerous

2016-04-13	|One of the reasons I support both Trump and Sanders is in the hopes that Americans become more privy to the corruption we have. When party activists in Colorado can choose delegates without any input from the voters, and those activists are establishment supporters, there is nothing that will persuade those activists to pick any delegates who support an insurgent candidate. The entire process is designed to stop insurgent candidates (which is what Trump is).

2016-04-13	Please explain better. You know you're lying.
2016-04-13	Hawaii uses the same Caucus-convention-delegate system as Colorado. In Hawaii, Trump supporters actually bothered to participate and won; In Colorado, VERY FEW Trump supporters showed up for the caucuses and they got slaughtered. So Trump whines about the PROCESS in Colorado, when it's his SUPPORTERS that failed.
2016-04-13	Mike Openshaw ARE YOU A REPUBLICAN? OR, a TROLL???
2016-04-13	One more instance where Trump's ignorance of the facts results in sour grapes. This brilliant winner who says 'trust me' can't be trusted after all to know what he's doing. Why is it he's having problems and everyone else knew what they needed to do? One more conspiracy to add to Trump's list of them. If he can't navigate the primaries how is he going to handle the Congress or world bodies? I expect if successful, all you are going to get from him are excuses. Trump's new tag should be I'm a winner or have a good excuse.

2016-04-13	Kasich is a joke at this point. He's in fourth place in a three man race.
2016-04-13	Kasich's thesis is that he can help deny Trump the nomination by winning states in the east. Polling suggests he's wrong. He's in the 20's in NY, CT, MD, and PA. He ought to drop out after New York. At that point it's going to be obvious he's not succeeding in his plan to win eastern states and is only helping Trump win the nomination by splintering the vote.
2016-04-13	Jon Worley Is it possible that by him dropping out it would help Trump even more? Especially in the remaining proportional / WTM states that award by congressional districts? I would expect some of Kasich support would either not vote or vote for Trump.

2016-04-13	There's no mess. 1237 is 50% +1. That's what you need to win. That's what every candidate has always needed to win. If you don't get to 50% + 1, you don't have a majority and you're not the nominee. When he references 1100 he's saying that if Trump get's THAT close on the first ballot, the unbound delegates will likely switch and put him over the top. The 1000 comes into play because he's saying if he gets less than that there's very little chance he'll get enough delegates on the first day. This stuff really isn't that complicated. The fact that Trump is unable to comprehend simple math and simple rules is why this is a problem for him to begin with.
2016-04-13	after 50 plus yearsas a Republican I just realized the Republican Party just nothing but a private club controlled by the leaders Washington DC which Direct the organizations throughout the country this is not the way the Constitution was was established on the two party system based on The Voice of the people not the people good now run the club this spending Millions to stop Trump and stifle the voice of the people time to wake up before it's too late Colorado is the perfect example and that's just the beginning of the next few months
2016-04-13	Yes..All of these years we were brought up to believe that ANYONE can be president...What they failed to disclose is that you must be a part of the fraternity FIRST..and have the approval of that group before you can run...Isn't that a kick in the face of everything we were taught?
2016-04-13	The two party system is established in the Constitution? Please tell me where the Constitution discusses parties at all. When you claim a Republican for 50 years, did you not learn anything about Government during that long time?
2016-04-13	All political parties are private clubs. That's what a political party is. Except for pohibitions on discimination and charging money to join, it can run itself internally any way it wants. The constitution and the law cares no more about the internal workings of a political party than it does you neighborhood book club. Americans need to learn how our system actually works.
2016-04-13	The possibilities are endless!

2016-04-13	The article is amazingly incomplete.. Fails to deal with obvious question of " How can Trump win with less then 1,237 delegates".
2016-04-13	Right? Woefully incomplete. Weird.
2016-04-13	|Exactly. Is he saying that there are enough uncommitted delegates who would say "close enough," and climb aboard or... something else? Anybody see the segment able to comment on whether there was context or a follow-up question? Does the author of the article know how to contact the guy who said it for a follow-up/clarification?

I sometimes defend Politico when it's criticized for bad journalism. But not when it's crap like this.|
2016-04-13	|Just watched the segment. He was answering a question from Luke Russert. Was evidently talking about unbound delegates/delegates released by Rubio and others.

It's at the very end of the segment, and was how they finished (no follow-up to clarify anything):
