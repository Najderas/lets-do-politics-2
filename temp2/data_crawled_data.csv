2016-04-01	Once again the Trump organization shows they don't do their homework, understand the process, or hire the right people. "Make America Unprepared".

2016-04-01	Russ Gallegher Oh stop whining, want to run for president? then you are expected to know your positions and "I dont know doesnt cut it". He was unprepared and he should have been?
2016-04-01	Russ Gallegher Because a potential POTUS should only be prepared for one issue at a time, at a dullard's pace..... damn you trump-lickers are stupid.
2016-04-01	I hope Cruz is the GOP nominee. He would be easier for Hillary to beat than Trump.
2016-04-01	They both are likely to lose, but I think Trump would lose by a wider margin. That's what all the polls say at least.
2016-04-01	Daniel Warren Curtis I don't think so. If Cruz is the nominee Trump supporters will sit at home on election day. IMO
2016-04-01	Mark Wood Because they believe in America that much, right?
2016-04-01	It truly does not matter what the process is anymore. If Trump goes into the convention with more delegates than anyone else and looses the nomination the reaction will be fast and furious. The damage to the party that Trump has done is already a for gone conclusion allowed to happen by the GOP. What happens at the convention is only an extension of that failure.
2016-04-01	Agreed. The Republican Party is to blame for the rise of Trump. Trump, the GOP Presidential nominees, Priebus, Ryan, Republicans in Congress, and Republicans in general basically support the SAME unconscionable POLICIES. The blame lies primarily with the Republican Party, who support these monsters, that feeds on bigotry, fiscal irresponsibility, ignorance, warmongering, and HATE, media like FOX news, who welcomes/supports these ignorant Bigots. GOP and T-Party are one and the same, and Voters who voted for them are no better than this GOP FILTH: You propped them up, nurtured them, VOTED for...See More
2016-04-01	Daniel Williams NO, government in general is the reason for the rise in TRUMP. Government has done nothing but gridlock, politicians have lost touch with the taxpayers that support them, Vote themselves healthcare, retirement, excessive spending, etc. and then cast their power on the common people as if we are all idiots that need their expertise on every matter. the entitlements run rampent to the tune of $20T in overspending, honoring a democratic candidate that needs and will be arrested soon if it had not been for OBAMA sequester of the indictment papers, it would have already happened. TIRED of the same political maneuvers to get what they want. I believe the backlash will occur if Trump falls just short of 1237 and rightly so it should, shows the people's voice does not matter, but those of power and money take over.
2016-04-01	Daniel Neal no one is getting arrested, sweetie. Santa isn't coming. Settle,down.
2016-04-01	For someone who says he is the best at everything ... especially at negotiation ... he seems to be losing the game.   Maybe Trump can offer delegates free tuition at Trump University, or free rides on Trump Airlines or a free suscription to Trump Magazine.      The convention will be the best reality show ever ... and the GOP will turn to Donald and say "You're Fired"

2016-04-01	To even waste a thought that Bernie would be able to somehow get the nomination is completely and utterly ludicrous. The Democrat side has been chosen since Obama's last election in 2012. The Enabler has paid for this nomination and the DNC is more than happy to capitulate. It's more of a coranation than an actual election cycle. Our politics have become so horribly corrupt I can't imagine what things will be like in 20 years, we probably won't even vote by then.
2016-04-01	Zach and Daniel, you two could not be more ignorant of the current situation. His views on foreign policy are pretty clear from the debates and from what he's posted on his website.      Plus he outperforms Hillary versus the Republicans in LITERALLY every single national poll. Those same polls show that Hillary winning the nomination would almost GUARANTEE a Republican in the White House.

Bernie Sanders significantly outperforms her in the head-to-head versus all of the Republican candidates.      Besides, I know a lot disenfranchised former Democratic voters that just don't trust her and would rather vote third party or independent than support another lying, big money candidate that's backtracked on almost every single issue.

2016-04-01	Reality is often much different than the Hillbots' perception of it.      Though, to be fair, what this boils down to is:      1) Yes, she may have broken the law (after all, the FBI wouldn't commit ~150 agents if there wasn't something there)...      but...      2) To riff on a Trumpism, her robotic parishoners would still support her if she murdered someone in the street.

2016-04-01	Smart move on their part in order to keep their stories straight. Fact of the matter is though that someone removed those classification markings from classified materials on order to send them over unsecure means to the clot. And due to the nature of some of the materials, the clot knew they were classified, but didn't mind sending the stuff on to her minions over her unsecured server. A quote was once used by Ben Franklin, a much more honoralbe person than this lot. "We must, indeed, all hang together, or we shall surely hang separately". Seems like this bunch has heard that somewhere. The noose is tightening
2016-04-01	It's a bag job all the way. The noose won't tighten because the fix is in.

2016-04-01	And Bernie will still lose the democratic nomination.
2016-04-01	Perhaps....but Hillary is worried. Hence, her rather caustic "tone" today to the Greenpeace activist, who did not even represent the Bernie Sanders campaign. She was far ahead in Wisconsin, and will probably lose on Tuesday. Her lead in New York was over 30 points a couple of weeks ago, and yesterday, a poll had it down to 12, with 19 days still to go. And here is an interesting article from the LA Progressive on Hillary's so-called huge advantage of non-white voters: https://www.laprogressive.com/hillary-fading/...
2016-04-01	David Hart Winning by a small percentage does not help Sanders. He needs to win by large margins.
2016-04-01	William Johnson 57% of the vote is large margins?
2016-04-01	This will answer the question .. Can you buy an election? Does it matter where the money comes from? How do I know for sure the money comes from 'the people' .. ? I know this, I would never give a Lincoln penny to a politcian .. specially one that has lived off the taxpayers his entire life .. I don't think so.
2016-04-01	Got it, you prefer corporate and special interest money funding elections.      I prefer public funding. It does matter where the money comes from. We will end Citizens United.
2016-04-01	Jonathan West I would prefer people are not stupid and change this process where there is a CAP per month, per candidate -- no candidate should have an advantage in how much money they spend or collect-- they need to use ingenuity and skill on how they spend the same amount to get the word out.. A percentage must come from the public, and a percentage from businesses.
2016-04-01	Then where else is the money coming from? Under his mattress? Believe me, after all this time if Bernie's money was coming from anywhere else somewhere else, as much opposition as he's had from media and people like you, it would have been revealed by now. He's not hiding anything like Hillary Clinton who won't even release her speech transcripts for the voters to see. So that's an ignorant statement, but I can understand stupid statements about a candidate when one just wants to vote against his or her own best interest and vote for the candidate who will take them backwards and not forward. Go Bernie!!!
2016-04-01	He is good at getting his devoted true believers to cough up $; unfortunately, it is VOTES and DELEGATES that win the nomination. Even if Hillary's MILLIONS more voters do nothing but vote for her - she wins.
2016-04-01	....reminds me of a cheerleader who wants to end the game at halftime bc her team is ahead. Sorry, but people are waking up to what a douche Hillary really is. (Is "douche" a unisex term? Insert pantsuit joke here.) Hey here's a thought: do you really want to see this woman wearing pantsuits on TV every night until she gets impeached?
2016-04-01	You mean the couple million more when not accounting for caucus voters, since raw votes aren't released or sometimes even counted as an aggregate¿
2016-04-01	And if she wins the millions of bernie voters will vote Trump. :) #BernieOrBust
2016-04-01	2016 is hardly the ideal year for the Dems to nominate an open socialist - with the spectre of Trump in the opposition. Bernie clearly hasn't sealed the deal on selling his socialism to the country; his 'revolution' hasn't fully arrived as an obviously electable majority.
2016-04-01	Sanders polls significantly better vs. trump than Clinton does...
2016-04-01	Actually, national polling has him beating every republican competitor by a larger margin that Hillary does. Please stop regurgitating the unsupported time-warner (Clinton campaign donor) narrative that is a lie.

He and his surrogate supporter Susan Sarrandon (and her belief that Trump is better for America than Hillary) are trolling the bottom of the barrel with innuendo and guilt by association.

2016-04-01	Hillary Supporters remind me why I won't vote for her.
2016-04-01	Dude his campaign is not negative. If him pointing out legitimate differences between he and his opponent comes off as negative, then maybe she's just wrong on a few things andd by that i mean everything that she hasn't "adopted" ffrom Sanders yet. And as far as working for an oil company goes. Its not like an individual secretary for BP is gonna have enough money to cough up to legitimately fund a campaign. These people who work for these fuel companies funding her are "lobbyist and maybe executives". If it were a secretary, rig worker, or janitor it would go down as an individual donation not attached to some corporate entity. When i donate money to Bernie Sanders it goes down as an individual donation. They dont know who I work for and it wouldnt matter either.
2016-04-01	Sanders is lying about the fossil fuel donations. http://www.politico.com/.../hillary-clinton-bernie...
2016-04-01	Read the whole thing. Those "employees" were LOBBYISTS for the fossil fuel industry. She's using the absolute loosest definition of the word employee to cover up that she has been given hundreds of thousands from those 57 people in addition to the millions the industry itself has given to her SuperPACs.   Of course the companies themselves haven't given directly to her campaign, they're not ALLOWED to, claiming that's what Sanders meant is beyond disingenuous.

2016-04-01	Yes ... every time Bernie points out factual differences between he and hillary   out come the hillary whiners ...   Bernie did this and Bernie did that   Sounding more like the 5 year old Trump every day ...
2016-04-01	Facts make Hillary Clinton supporters uncomfortable, because all they have is typical Republican Tactics: misrepresentation, outright lying, hiding behind bullshit, etc.      When challenged in Policy, on the Issues, they shut up very quickly & begin to sling heavier insults of topics that have absolutely nothing to do with the candidate's Policies.      Guess what though? Americans are slowly waking up to that fact, and there's nothing you can do about it because enough of them are noticing that it is making a difference.      A big enough difference, that Clinton's foundation (Non-White votes) have dissolved as non-whites switch to Bernie Sanders.      http://www.huffingtonpost.com/.../hillary-clintons...
2016-04-01	The longer the race goes on, the more it favors the candidate who represents the Truth. The more people get to know who he is, and when they do they switch over to him from Clinton very quickly. By the time he reaches California, he will have had enough time & so much money that everyone will know who he is, what he stands on, and the truth will obliterate Clinton as he overtakes her delegate lead & wins the nomination.      June 7th, the day Bernie Sanders is solidified as the future President of the United States.      And on that day? Oh, all the Hillbots & their Trump-Like behavior will just explode as they scramble to gather their collective head, "But HOW?! The MainStream Media promised us Clinton was 100% inevitable!? BUT HOW?!"      Math is how. Math, Truth, & Time.
2016-04-01	A closed primary for registered democrats only, no way Bernie. Voter registration closed on the 25th of March.
2016-04-01	And the deadline to change party affiliation to Democrat was October 9th; voter suppression anyone?      New York has one of the most cohesive party systems in the country, and you can bet the local Democrats will do everything in their power to stop Bernie Sanders from winning a state that Secretary Clinton really, really ought to win.      Good luck to them, because going to a college with over 18,000 students, I would bet that over 90% of us would support Bernie as our first choice. Unfortunately, due to the terribly constructed way the primary in New York is run, most of us are disenfranchised.      Great job Democrats, risking a prime opportunity to get the Millenials to support you for a generation in order to coronate Hillary.
2016-04-01	Tom Planamento why is it voter suppression? These aren't new rules. They weren't implanted for the benefit of one candidate over another...
2016-04-01	Tom Planamento Why is a dealine voter suppression? Bills come with dealines.. if you miss it, does that mean you are now the subject of " payment suppression" because you didn't pay ontime? Homework for students has a dealine.. if you don't meet that deadline, is that now " student suppression"? Come on man.. if the youth want to truly be involved and have a voice, stop showing up late to the party and do some real investing. If people want to vote, they should invest the time to find out how, where, when and what are the requirments. Google is everyone's friend these days and it takes 3 mnutes. There always seems to be an excuse, but little aceptance of blame.
2016-04-01	Sanders is a fraud and no way in hell is he gonna win NEW YORK, fuck him and his socialism BS, you want to pay 5 or 6 bucks a gallon for fuel, or a 50% payroll tax move to Europe, that BS will never fly here, Clinton will soon get the nomination with wins in NY, Pennsylvania, DC, Maryland, Connecticut, then Jersey, California, Sanders is a poor mans Ben Carson, Garbage, I would vote for Trump before that senile old fuck..
2016-04-01	In what world is Sanders proposing a 50% payroll tax or measures that would triple the cost of gas?      He's proposing a 2.4% payroll and measures that would marginally increase the cost of gas by      1) Reducing subsidies that go towards development of oil/NG production.   2) Creating a sort of trust where oil companies pay a portion of their revenue into it that would be used to fund environmental cleanup efforts and federal purchasing of land to expand national parks and reserves.
2016-04-01	You'll be paying around $6,000 more per family
2016-04-01	Ignorant much?
2016-04-01	Wow the hubris. "She wins only in the South" well completing ignoring he only wins caucus states with large populations of whites?! I see his old ass starting to have early onset dementia. For him to try to disenfranchise voters and say they don't count because of a particular region is ludicrous. If Hillary had stated oh well he only wins lily white caucuses there would be a backlash but nope not God ole Bernie. GTFO here, I got 3 votes for HRC in NY yesterday and I'm going to work on getting more.
2016-04-01	Yes, only the south and red states. You know like southern Ohio, Iowa, mass, and let's remember Florida isn't important in the general.
2016-04-01	You are wrong. Washington is the 7th most diverse state, Hawaii has never had a majority white population, and Alaska is said to be one of the most diverse states in the country.
2016-04-01	Andrew Koss Virginia too
2016-04-01	when hillary started losing in 2008   her supporters started calling Obama cuss words, a lot of nonsense in their comments   had nothing good to say about the President that hillary would, "then serve" for the next 4 years   Maybe we can get Bernie to hold some minor position open for her too ...
2016-04-01	Hillary DID end up campaigning for Obama far more than any other nomination runner up did for the nominee in any election year. I bet Sanders won't campaign at all for Hillary if she ends up being the nominee.

2016-04-01	Well that is an honest statement. Kasich is not insane. If it came down to choosing between Hillary and Kasich..... yeeesh...... I might actually support Kasich to keep Hillary out, not that I would feel good about it. As much as I find kasich vile and repugnant, he is less repugnant than Hillary.      The set-backs that would come form a Kasich presidency would be more easily undone than the selling us out and backstabbing that Hillary would do. I will never be able to forgive her for BAPCPA.
2016-04-01	Bryan yes, Governor Kasich is the adult in the room. But his views on public education, a women's right to choose, he is anti union, he is supported by ALEC and the Koch brothers who not only have libertarian points of view but are also influenced by John Birtch Society values and goals. His part in Lehman brothers and the collapse of the American economy in 2008 is still suspect. The setbacks from a kasich administration would not easily be undone. All one has to do is look at George W. we are still trying to recover from him. With all due respect.
2016-04-01	Neal Levine you may be right. I guess I just would have to decide in that instance if I would rather be betrayed by Hillary or just out right abused. Either way, it would suck. That would not be an easy choice. Thankfully for me I live in a thoroughly blue state so I have guilt free voting for third party candidates or write in. Those in closer contests..... yuck, I do not envy them.
2016-04-01	As a liberal Democrat myself, I don't find kasich vile and repugnant at all. I obviously do not agree with many of his positions, but from what I do know of the man, I can't help but agree with Sanders 100% on this: he's not crazy. His arguments are sound, and he hardly ever engages in formal logical fallacies like everyone else does.      He has demonstrated, times and time again, the ability to work with the opposition in order to accomplish the ultimate goal: governing this nation. He has worked with Bill Clinton throughout the 90s, and vice-versa.      That is what I expect of ALL Congresspeople...See More

2016-04-01	I'm sure that at least one of the people who has donated to Bernie Sanders has been convicted of DUI. WHY ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF DRUNK DRIVING, SENATOR?
2016-04-01	First, obviously that metaphor makes little sense. But still, nobody with a DUI is lobbying DC to make sure DUIs get eliminated. The fossil fuel industry is actively trying to suppress environmental causes.      Second, the activist who started this by approaching Clinton was from Greenpeace. They are NOT coordinating with the Sanders campaign and have their own agenda when it comes to the environment - in fact, they've been asking Clinton for months to sign the same pledge Martin O'Malley and Sanders did to not take any money from fracking or the fossil fuel industry. Clinton still has not signed this.
2016-04-01	Nathan Deming It makes perfect sense, because it's also an extreme distortion of reality.      As for your precious pledge, Bernie has received money from people who work in the fossil fuel industry. So he's got suppressing environmental causes on his agenda, right?
2016-04-01	Nathan Deming It actually does make sense. Clinton is insinuating that money coming from workers in an industry is the same as money coming from CEOs and professional lobbyists from that same industry. Lobbyists are professional investors, workers are not.

2016-04-01	Actually, he's not lying on that one. Legally, a candidate cannot have contact with a super PAC supporting them. It's because super PACs are supposed to be independant from the campaign since they are advertising on behalf of the candidate and skirting donation caps.

2016-04-01	They need to laugh in his face. It was Cruz that said himself that he's a Christian first, American second. He needs to get his money from Christian organizations and donors.
2016-04-01	Yeah, one day conservative Jewish Americans who have cynically supported the right wing, just because the right supports Israel - one day they may regret it. The fervent wish of evangelicals is that all Jews be converted. The American Jewish right wing is possibly sacrificing its long-term interests for short-term gains. The Christian evangelical mission is to get rid of anyone not like them - anyone and everyone. They have the same aims as fundamentalists of any religion.
2016-04-01	I think before he goes he needs to disavow Ted Nugent. Ted Nugent is a fierce anti-semite and if one has read his web page one would know that Ted hates jews. So far Ted Cruz has not disavowed Mr Nugent at all. Mr. Cruz has also been condemned by the anti-defamation league for singling out Muslim Neighborhoods in the United States for added Police scrutiny. As the anti-defamation league put it that it would be throwback to the 1930s and 1940s in Nazi Germany. And this is who the GOP is turning to instead of Donald Trump. Truly you can't make this stuff up.
2016-04-01	the real criminals are all the settlers in Israel. what they are doing to the Palastinians is the new holocaust. Especially the ones who are going out of the zones and making colonies on arab zoned land, and then they wonder why the arabs are mad. I am not a Ted Nugent fan and I am no Anti-semite. I believe in piece, and I believe in what I think is right. There is no way any one can explain to me how the new "settlers" are right in what they are doing in Israel.
2016-04-01	Patrick Dannunzio it takes two for a two state solution. Until there is a willing partner it is what it is.
2016-04-01	Patrick Dannunzio agreed
2016-04-01	Good luck .. this is so laughable.
2016-04-01	Hope he let's them in on the fact that Rafael has said Christians must be in control of all sectors of society (Seven Mountains mandate) so the end times will come. Ted is annointed King to bring back the spoils of war to the priest.. I can't wait for the transfer of wealth from the wicked to the righteous gentiles; according to Rafeal. Once they get this all worked out then Jesus can come back. Right befor he does luckily the Jews will be given the chance to convert so there is that. Cruz= Dominionist
2016-04-01	I don't understand why we let Jewish interests flood our policy. Let Israel handle their own problems that they caused. Now if the arabs just go attacking children and what not, then sure help, but if the arabs are attacking because these new "settlers" are taking their land, then #uck them, that is their own agenda and problem. This is sopposed to be a christian country.
2016-04-01	Limbaugh has been hedging about Trump for Months.      If he says anything nice about Trump he loses what little respect anyone has for his "intellect".   If he says anything bad about Trump he is scared of the Red Hats calling him names.
2016-04-01	He managed to whimper out a ''I don't think George W knew there were no WMD's.   So Mr. Trump, you, sir, might, possibly have misspoken there."   Its really amazing.
2016-04-01	They say even a stopped clock is right twice a day.      Limbaugh nailed the 2016 election right there. Everybody sucks.

2016-04-01	So in your eyes, trump and cruz are equally as bad as Sanders and Clinton? If so I can't take you seriously .
2016-04-01	Carl Rice Equally? Equally is meaningless. They're all bad. Varying degrees of bad, but bad.      In other words, they don't all suck equally, but they all most definitely suck.
2016-04-01	Sanders = naive   Hillary = corrupt, compulsive liar   Trump = clueless   Cruz = shady      Yup, they all suck.
2016-04-01	you forgot to add corrupt, compulsive liar to Trump as well
2016-04-01	Oh brother... the ol "liar" talking point yet NOBODY can say what she allegedly LIED about?? And what CORRUPTIONS?? Really? They are so obvious that everyone didn't do anything about it?? Sanders has been in Politics 40 years, he knows a lot more than your dumb ass

2016-04-01	Hope he included himself in that..

2016-04-01	I find it amusing that after 8 months of campaigning the GOP is acting unified to defeat Donald Trump. Even though the damage has been done. To little to late because their knight in shinning armor is none other than drumb roll please. Mini Trump who wants to put more police in Muslim Neighborhoods, who wants no exceptions for abortions like the health of the mother, rape or incest. Yes Mini Trump the savior of the GOP. How pathetic is this.

2016-04-01	The GOP are already toast in this election circle and they know it. Their focus now is the long term. They are doing their best to minimize the damages Trump and his supporters are currently doing to their brand. At a time when they need to attract a more diverse support base their front runner is busy alienating all relevant voting blocks with the exception of white men. The Republicans are not going to recover from this any time soon.
2016-04-01	Abdulai Bah : "Their focus now is the long term."   ==================      What kind of long term focus? Hating Latinos? That is a recipe for political suicide.
2016-04-01	My fellow Americans! I too had an approval of Mr. Trump to run. But during the course of these last few months I must admit his naivete in regards to politics is going to be his undoing and as well a little dangerous. I understand the anger and frustration of my fellow Americans with our government but to put someone in charge with the most important job in the free world of any countries on this planet is frankly too dangerous for me to cast a vote for him. Republican or Democrat Think very carefully my friends regarding the vote for November!!
2016-04-01	I up voted you and I welcome you to sanity.
2016-04-01	The US Chamber of Commerce is in bed with cheap labor and open borders...Who cares what they think? Besides..most Americans are already experiencing a recession..It's never ended. They will do and say anything to disrupt the Trump train..much like the media and the establishment GOP...Remember they are implimenting their 100 day program against Trump...What we have on our side is voter enthusiam...Don't listen to any of their rhetoric..get to the polls folks!
2016-04-01	In your rambling incoherent attack-the-messenger nonresponse, you shockingly fail to rebut the premise that tariffs spark a trade war, or at best, causes retailers to raise prices and pass the increased expenses directly on to the consumer.
2016-04-01	I hope your enthusiasm will keep you warm and pay the bills when the SHTF if we should be so cursed as to have Trump elected President. You say don't listen to the rhetoric, what the hell do you have against common sense? Never mind, if you had any common sense, you wouldn't be a Trump supporter.
2016-04-01	Michael Eisenberg Rambling and incoherent rant??..Comprehension problems?? Do tell...what will happen in seven years with California raising the minimum wage of $15 dollars for burger flippers?? How does that work? Won't that cause retailers to raise prices and pass increased expenses directly on to the consumer as well?? I think trade deals are the least of our problems with progressives running the country..
2016-04-01	Trump has little understanding of economics. It has been often reported that if he had taken the fortune he inherited from his daddy and simply let it sit in a no-brainer index fund, he would be richer than he is today.
2016-04-01	Actually at "Trump has little understanding of_______" Just fill in the blank and you're going to be right.
2016-04-01	We owe China billions, and Trump wants to risk and economic war with them. Am I th only one who sees a problem here?
2016-04-01	There are others, but you are wrong in your opinion. China has no effective way to use the loans - they aren't callable, and if China sells them, the dollar declines and makes US manufacturing more competitive against the Chinese manufacturing sector, all to the betterment of the US.
2016-04-01	Draenar Dubrovna -- Where are the factories for these US manufacturing jobs? How many years will it take to build them and bring them on line? We are no longer a manufacturing based economy but some people just can't figure it out.
2016-04-01	Alan Boorstein: I think you are wrong sir. This country could build plants here; train workers; and pay a livable wage, in a reasonable amount of time. Just because blue collar jobs have seemingly disappeared; doesn't mean the citizens whom would benefit from them have.

2016-04-01	Richard John Stacy As Clinton once said when questioning David Petraeus "You have been made the de facto spokesmen for what many of us believe to be a failed policy in Iraq, Despite what I view is your rather extraordinary efforts in your testimony both yesterday and today, I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief."      Not only was Petraeus policy successful but she blew it all and still lies about it. She turned wine into vinegar. And how much disbelief are the American people supposed to engourge upon so that what she says will be deembed to be true?

I believe him.
2016-04-01	Sherry Wendenland Ted Cruz is an establishment globalist. He voted for the TPA so-called "trade" agreement that will destroy U.S. sovereignty and nullify laws written in Congress. He wrote an amendment to the 'Gang of 8' bill to legalize all illegal immigrants in this country. He wouldn't give them citizenship right away, but he would legalize all of them. He wrote a bill to increase H1B visas by 500% -- these are the technical jobs that are being robbed from the American people by Chinese and Indian programmers willing to work for half the cost. Ted Cruz is a snake who lies and steals others ideas and uses them as his own. He is not an original thinker and he is a danger to this country. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXcYCwaBKnQ...
2016-04-01	Sherry Wendenland "BILL BENNETt on his show today.......Warning someone is going to try to Kill Trump. I believe him."

2016-04-01	Jim Morris Because they're establishment Republican party insiders, that are _NOT_ allowing the people of North Dakota a say in what is supposed to be a Democratic process (ie. choosing a nominee).
2016-04-01	Carson giving the speech for Trump, its in the bag for Cruz. I can ony imagine what damage Carson will do, "I come to praise Caesar, not to bury him" in his case.
2016-04-01	Knowing Carson, he will somehow suggest Donald Trump actually shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue.
2016-04-01	Now that the pressure is off..........Dr. CArson is a fine speaker. he also swings great weight with Evangelicals and Home schoolers. he goes to the conventions. Sells his books there. North Dakota has home schoolers. Distances between ranches and such are great. it is also frozen in the North.

Get back to your knitting and keep your appoinements with your psychiatrist. And if you have to hate, and apparently you do, try thought first.

2016-04-01	Krzysztof Why don't you know? Trump has been telling you what he would do with foreign policy since he has been campaigning. He doesn’t have a clue.

And what's your plan for fixing the Middle East that has been at war with each other forever? Trump has thrived on low information voters (LIV’s), are you one of them?

2016-04-01	Terry Doe Terry your future president plans to punish women who have abortions, he plans to give   nukes to South Korea and Japan, he plans to drop out of NATO oh and I almost forgot, just could   end up dropping a nuke on Europe. When Bush left office he had a 32% approval, Obama is at   right around 50%, not bac for being born "pathetic".....
2016-04-01	Alan Karns That just highlights the mental disease of liberalism as the scumbag has led our nation in a race to the bottom.
2016-04-01	Tim Holt I find it interesting that conservatives either use name calling or are convinced that because we disagree we must have mental disease... we just disagree.
2016-04-01	Obama should spread the wealth around and share some of that Green Crack he has been smoking because I want to be as high as he is..............ahhhhhhaaa.      Obama can't even say Islamic Terrorism what does he know about National Security or Nukes, nothing.
2016-04-01	He knows that the US policy for the last several decades has been to LIMIT the number of nuclear weapons. Leave it to a simple-minded asshole like Trump to suggest INCREASING nuclear presence throughout the world.      But what more can we expect from former Bushbots.
2016-04-01	Anthony S. Moore Yes limit the number of nuclear weapons for America but increase the weapons in the Middle East... Mission Accomplished for his old friends the Islamic Terrorists.
2016-04-01	I sinecerly doubt your qualitied to make that assessment. Just popping off. Go whack off somewhere else.
2016-04-01	Obama clown prince of America he talked about his nuclear proliferation success what success Obama don't you read the news Russia is doubling the number of its warheads
2016-04-02	And off the rails the campaign goes.
2016-04-02	You are correct, Heinrich Wald. It's imploding as we speak. I realize this type of remark, or prediction, has been made for months, but this time, it's spot-on.

2016-04-02	Ben Dovere it must be hard making all your decisions with only a brain stem. One of the few not worthy of donating, I might add.
2016-04-02	You can't make this stuff up. First The Donald is walking back his comments on abortion not once but twice. It went from women should be punished to I miss poked to now the abortion laws should stay where they are until I become President. With Lewandowski it was he did not touch that women. Then it was she made it up. Then it was she lied and over exaggerated what happened and now he is no where to be seen. Truly this is different from penis size, peeing in one's pants to whose wife is sleazier. Amazing.
2016-04-02	His lack of integrity and consistency on anything is mindboggling. Even his own supporters should be wondering 'Is he just playing me?'...why not, he does it to everyone else.
2016-04-02	Mark Keeler oh no, their messiah would never "play them" for fools. Trump only does that to "those people"!
2016-04-02	Donald Trump is not a panty sniffer who goes around regulating what women to with their sex organs. Never has been.   He said the law says it is legal. Until the law it changed don't give me hypothetical questions. He did not say he would change the law. He did not say he would not change the law      I think on his list of what is important that is about 354.   Shut up already. Go peddle your crap to someone who believes.........Cruz. or pretends to belive

2016-04-02	It makes absolute sense for certain kinds of reporters to be banned from campaign events because of their obvious bias and hostility. Trump is trying to win a nomination not make hostile reporters happy.

2016-04-02	The Trump campaign hasn't spent much money anywhere, so no news there. The Clinton campaign knows the score, and is clearly in general election mode as far as campaign spending/budgeting is concerned. They have already spent $70 million locking up prime ad time slots in the lead up to November.

2016-04-02	Jesse Cooday No need to be cryptic. The Clinton Campaign is a very data driven organization. They've known for some time, that despite Sander's recent wins, the path to the nomination is all but impossible. Knowing this, resources are allocated to most effectively to accomplish their goals, 1. Make their best effort to secure the WH for the Democratic Party. 2. Help elect other Democrats to House and Senate seats. It's called working toward actual progressive change. To accomplish this, they have to grit their teeth, and take it on the chin in places like Washington, Hawaii, and Alaska. They have to ease up on their attacks on Sanders, to work towards rallying support for the general. On the flip side, the Sanders campaign, must go for broke. Spend hard to attempt a Hail Mary in places like NY, and California, refuse to help in the down ballot races, and attack Clinton.
2016-04-02	Jesse Cooday You are absolutely right!
2016-04-02	The age distribution of support for Bernie v. Hillary is fascinating. Her edge is that older voters actually turnout consistently, but otherwise, I would be very concerned if I was her. It seems to forebode some real changes in the party.
2016-04-02	The Democratic Party needs the change - it is time to give up "GOP-Lite" - it would be good if Bernie would stop telling the young people that he has a magic wand and will be able to deliver free college and single payer health care (which, based on my newly acquired Medicare, is not great anyway). Hillary will be an excellent President.
2016-04-02	Linda Callanan when did he say he could deliver that? plz cite an example.
2016-04-02	Linda Callanan Nobody really expects those things to come about, and certainly not without a serious fight. But that's the point: he's willing to fight for it, and Hillary Clinton is not. He thinks it's worth it, she does not.      I'm with him.
2016-04-02	There are other numers to watch. Hillary and Bill Clinton’s close relations with Wall Street helped brought to financial bubbles (1999-2000 and 2005-8) and the Great Recession that followed Lehman’s collapse. In the 1990s they pushed financial deregulation for their campaign backers that in turn let loose the worst demons of financial manipulation, toxic assets, financial fraud, and eventually collapse. In the process they won elections and got mighty rich. Why no one is talking about this?
2016-04-02	Lots of folks are not only talking they are getting behind Bernie. Together we can do it.

Hardly the most popular and not of very good moral character with all of his sexual escapades with women dating back to his days as Governor of Arkansas.

2016-04-02	The only thing keeping Clinton in the lead is the huge amount of dirty tricks, help from the corporate owned media and the overwhelming support of the establishment.      Without the election fraud and media blackouts...Sanders would be crushing her already. His support amongst the young make it clear that this is the last time the Democrat Establishment is going to try this. The Democratic Party is going to come apart because of this election just like the 2008 loss to a black man destroyed the gop.      In our case...the election of a corporate owned candidate with the highest disapproval rating of any serious presidential candidate in history would be the final straw.
2016-04-02	Nope. Talk about grasping at straws. But by all means, continue on with misguided and misinformed conspiracy theories. At the very least they're entertaining.

2016-04-02	I have never been a one issue voter but this election is fundamentally different, after generations the supreme court ideological swing has a chance to go liberal, and i will vote for whoever the democratic nominee is be it sanders or clinton, because i feel that it is imperative that the next two or three supreme court judges be left wing liberals, not right wing conservatives. This issue is more important than any issue in this election cycle. Voter ID,affirmative action, reproductive rights, unions, LGBT rights. All of these rights would be protected with a liberal supreme court majority.

2016-04-02	There have been enough debates. We've heard Bernie Sanders answer every question with "Wall Street" and "revolution" too much already. New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio said about Hillary:      There has been a “disservice done to Hillary,” he said. “Everyone knew she was a progressive going back to the '70s. She has a thoroughly progressive history; it manifested in the healthcare fight where she was pushing the spectrum in an extraordinary way. I’m firmly in the camp that HER VISION FOR WALL STREET IS MORE RIGOROUS AND PROGRESSIVE THAN BERNIE'S."
2016-04-02	The more people hear Sen. Sanders, the more they like him. It seems the opposite is true for his opponent, for some reason.

2016-04-02	Rudyard Danniken the more I hear him the more I dislike him.
2016-04-02	The attention from Trump's comment on abortion should be more about his lack of understanding of an important policy issue. He has no real understanding of the major issues facing the country as with his comment about nuclear arming Japan and South Korea. His thought on issues is shallow and lacks any depth of understanding. The guy just hasn't been thinking about this stuff much aside from others just watching cable news. Its like letting someone perform an operation because he regularly watched Grey's Anatomy. I don't think so.

2016-04-02	The bottom line is this. Donald Trump was only talking about the logical final step in outlawing abortion. It is the dirty little secret that the anti- abortion groups and individuals do not want to talk about. If abortion is murder there has to be punishment. The anti abortionist want to shift and place the blame on providers. However who should be charged with murder if their are no providers and the women self aborts herself? The only conclusion is she is the guilty one. Remember the female is already being blamed and getting punished for an abortion. Restriction place needless waiting per...See More

This comes from the wrongful belief that the press will look biased or accused of taking sides when in truth it is just reporting the facts as to what making abortion illegal will do to women
2016-04-02	Trump spoke the GOP truth but he just spoke it too soon. GOP wants to get a RWNJ majority on the SC and outlaw abortion first. You can be sure there will be harsh penalties for women that initiate the 'murder' , the Christotaliban will see to it.
2016-04-02	Self-funding, huh? Sure.

NOT a sum that would even put a "scratch" on his financial standing. And why would he spend even that much of his own money?      Why? The man is narcissistically disordered.

He plays the business man game in this area because he has that leverage; but it's really a deceitful tactic used as a talking point to make him appear tough to his strong-man stump speeches.

2016-04-02	agreed
2016-04-02	Yeah he's within only a couple of points on favourability and actually if I only had to choose between the theocratic dominionist and clueless Trump, I would pick Trump every time. Every time Trump spouts off, it's something he has 0 chance of getting through congress. With Cruz though there are enough theocrats in the Republican party, he might get his way. Unless the Democrats got control of the senate we could be screwed. I would expect him to turn SCOTUS into an institution that would persecute gays, overturn Roe v Wade and turn schools into christian madrassas. Not acceptable.

2016-04-02	So would he
2016-04-02	Ssssshhhhhh, you're not supposed to mention that.
2016-04-02	When Trump finally wins the GOP nomination he may even have to take on Sanders. I am not counting him out yet as he leads in Wisconsin.
2016-04-02	Wisconsin tells me nothing. You can't win a nomination or a general without NY, CA, or FL
2016-04-02	Mark Keeler Actually George Bush won in 2000 and 2004 without NY and CA with the last republican being Ronald Reagan in 1984 to win NY and Geroge HW Bush (41) to win CA in 1988. Trump puts NY in play - the suburbs around NYC really decide who "wins NY".
2016-04-02	Joseph Brunner It is possible for Trump to win. Cruz is a zero with Trump supporers. His faith is that of a lawyer: for sale.
2016-04-02	The only GOP candidate left that polls well against Hillary is Kasick and he has only won one measily state.
2016-04-02	It's only a mistake now, because the majority of all women find Trump objectionable. What a total pander!
2016-04-02	.......... A little too late, the problem is if he stop insulting people nobody will listen to him anymore. The only time he makes sense is when he talks crazy, trump if you stop insulting people you'll lose your base.
2016-04-02	thats usually the case . hes only saying this because his big mouth and childish behavior is costing him something.   if not this guy would never admit to anything.
2016-04-02	simple truth is Mr Trump is prolife. the Christian base of the republican party is prolife. me, I'm prochoice but will still be voting for Mr Trump. Why? because cruz and clinton are owned by goldman-sachs and I will not vote for a bank.      Vote Change, Vote Trump !
2016-04-02	He is admitting a mistake... That is a GREAT!
2016-04-02	It would be great if donald weren't a pathological liar. He's only saying it to try to get some women back in support of him. If they do go, they are crazier than he is.

2016-04-02	Bob Niemann Get over it! The next president will be a democrat.
2016-04-02	"It was 68 percent, actually."      Trump has a great standup comedy act.
2016-04-02	Yeah he must really be taking those polls that say women hate him seriously because he was tweet insulting Kelly this morning. He's in deep trouble and he knows it.
2016-04-02	waddayamean.. he loves women and women love him ask his wives.. and nobody respects women more than the donald... he said it so ... it must be true..   and lets face it. if thats what he calls respect... who would want it..      anyway ask his wives . carly fiorina kelly and rosie odonnell tostart with ...   if donny loves and respects women
2016-04-02	i love watching the wheels fall off the wagon. this is fun :-)
2016-04-02	Unfortunately if he gets the nomination, he hs a chance to get elected - no way of predicting events in the summer and fall. I find it more scarey than amusing.
2016-04-02	Well if by "fun" you mean "embarrassing and rather frightening"... then yeah. Whee!
2016-04-02	Leo T. Ward Trump will never, ever, ever, be president. You can take that to the bank.
2016-04-02	Right now as usual since the late '80's - It's all about the economy. A businessman named Trump knows the US economic engine and how to use leverage. "W" & Obama's spending and the debt it's generated combined with the Liberals who don't care if they pass it on to their grandchildren have empowered Trump.      Trump and most clear-thinking American's undestand debt. They have jobs and want better pay - and their kids need jobs to become invested in our Republic, to feel prepared to raise and support a family.

2016-04-02	Greg smith, the debt was almost $11 trillion before Obama became president, please what depression caused the debt before Obama? A great country like ours where people said everything was great before 2009 was indebted to the tune of $11 trillion and it was of no concern to any conservative .   Please conservatively speaking how much more should be added to our debt after the Great Depression of 2008, considering the fact that we amass $11 trillion without any depression? So how much more has Obama added over your estimate and adding the war debt that Bush left him? Oh Obama should have reduced the debt even after the greatest depression since the 2nd world war ended, a country that inccured a debt of $11 trillion in good times, please what would a conservative do that would have been different to Obama's action considering you created the problem in the first place?

2016-04-02	Unfair but perfectly legal. Just like declaring bankruptcy and leaving your creditors in the lurch. Right?
2016-04-02	They were Chapter 11 bankruptcies. Read up on them before you start making accusations about creditors being left in the lurch. This sort of bankruptcy keeps people employed...he could have just closed up shop and let everyone go...he did not.
2016-04-02	Lorielle Sisson In a Ch. 11, creditors most often end up with pennies on the dollar, so spare me your indignation.

2016-04-02	Jay Dee Hey, trump chump, go pound sand.
2016-04-02	Holy sheet - Another RNC fuster cluck !!   Anyone shocked ? Sheeee-iiit. THIS is why we need Donald Trump - to "once and for all" destroy the D.C. parties that despise the American middle class - in the (R) and the (D) party both. Both doing their very best to keep their gravytrain of lobbyists and politician puppets in place to destroy America as a sovereign free nation.      As long as the (D) & (R) party create and foster strife and confusion they succeed in slowly snuffing the lantern of Lady Liberty with feckless and UN centric leaders and debilitating, freedom eroding treaties.
2016-04-02	Grow up, did you think they would just roll over for him?

2016-04-03	Adam Sinclair....perhaps it's just that Democrats aren't so eager to work for a Sanders administration......
2016-04-03	Sour grapes, there - if Bernie was winning, he'd have plenty of people, too. Actually winning VOTES is Bernie's big problem - he does much better in little caucuses, which are much less convenient for many voters - and are thus less democratic than primaries (but doggone it, Hillary wins most of those).
2016-04-03	Wealth, power, clout, bundlers, The Clinton Foundation, illegal Chinese money. And the morons are going to try and put this corrupt POS back in office..

Bernie need EVERYONE'S help with phonebanking. Phonebanking is a very easy thing to do, and it's very important to the campaign too.

2016-04-03	Debbie Wasserman-Schultz is at the top of that list, and she better be. Seeing how she and the DNC have practically given the nomination to HilIary wrapped in a bow, she should be the poster child for the long line of corrupt brown-nosers at Queen HilIary's back door. Also that seat in congress she has so thoroughly defecated upon will no longer suffer her. Timothy Canova for Congress!
2016-04-03	Pretty sure it's the voters
2016-04-03	Sanders is not now and never has been a Democrat and now he wants all of their advantages. Carpetbagger.
2016-04-03	Mike Martin LOL, you replied to an add. Another informed Shillary voter.
2016-04-03	So when will The Lincoln Bedroom be back up for grabs?   Didn't Obama try to make policy that lobbyist couldn't get hired in govt within a certain period of time (eliminating the revolving door?)?   Didn't he then get rid of that sound policy in 2014 because it ended up being too hard and cumbersome for libs to abide by?   Don't you love it when politicians pretend to be bothered by money and influence in DC?
2016-04-03	Tammy McKinnon cut the hypocrisy. Considering the revolving doors awaiting lobbyists, it's hard for any president to completely foreswear lobbyists in their administration. At least Obama tried, and he greatly reduced that practice. For Republicans it's practically a job requirement to have been or plan to be a lobbyist.
2016-04-03	Cheryl Onstad LOL he tried? Really? Are you that freaking dumb? While you are at it why don't you look up how he broke his own policy from day one...Start with Timothy Geithner...You people are either dumber than dirt (and that is what the politicians count on) or you really don't care about all of the crap you spout when election season rolls around.

2016-04-03	I think he would be treated more fairly if he was scooping up their money so that he would owe them something. That is what this is all about...the fact that he will not be beholden to them....that means he would be the first President in decades to truly serve the people...what an amazing thing that would be.

2016-04-03	No doubt Dump is greatly concerned that all people be treated fairly.
2016-04-03	lol
2016-04-03	What does fair treatment mean in a party primary? That's not an easy question to answer.      To begin with, demanding the nomination if you have a pluarlity but not a majority of delegates on the 1st ballot is ASKING for unfair treatment in your favor. Trump has lobbied for that and that's completely out.      Beyond that, however, Trump may very well have grounds for complaint in the selection of delegates in states that he won. This could be true if those states conciously select anti-Trump delegates with an eye to dumping him on ballots after the 1st ballot.      I don't know enough about the normal processes used by states to select delegates to opine on this. But this is not an outrageous claim by Trump. For once he may have a leg to stand on here.
2016-04-03	Political parties are private organizations, free to make their own rules for how they nominate a candidate to represent the party in the election. They can nominate anyone they want, and it is only their internal rules that matter. Effectively, the primaries are simply a preferential poll that the parties use to help them decide who to nominate, rather than the first round of a legal run-off election, where a voter is actually voting directly for a candidate.      As non-governmental organizations, the parties have their own rules for how they pick delegates, their own rules for how they make t...See More
2016-04-03	Stanley Slawski : "Political parties are private organizations"   ==============   I cannot believe that an otherwise well informed, intelligent poster wrote the simplistic statement above. The FEC has no authority whatsoever over "private organizations" but the political parties better obey the FEC's every word.
2016-04-03	Stanley Slawski : "As non-governmental organizations, the parties have their own rules"   ============   Non-governmental organizations NEVER aspire to reach government power. That goal happens to be THE only one pursued by political parties. Your post is excellent, but you need to re-think two critical definitions: "private organization" and "NGO".      NGOs try to get support from the UN, for example. I doubt that the DNC and RNC will ever do that.      BTW: I gave you an upclick.

2016-04-03	only problem with your comment is that home school kids kick the crap out of public school kids test after test after test. look up the last few winners of Jeopardy spelling and geography bees - ALL HOME SCHOOL KIDS. and just to let you know, more and more wealthy parents are home schooling their kids. IOW - you don't know whhat your're talking about
2016-04-03	Billy Ray   And home schooling is something to be proud of? Kids need social interaction in their formative years or they grow up to be loners or hermits.
2016-04-03	Billy Ray - And that is a problem. Home school kids have no idea what it is like to live and work with others. Home schooling fosters elitism and a lack of community. That is why repube can walk on the middle class and the poor without a heart.   There is more to education than passing tests and memorizing spelling words.

2016-04-03	FUK this guy, he again did a NON answer about abortion and the ol "leave it up to the states" bullshit answer they give when they want to skirt and avoid an issue. Why should people have their civil right be dependent on the state they are in?
2016-04-03	Abortion isn't a civil right idiot
2016-04-03	Craig Maggi Jr. Idiots like you are a waste of space. If its not a CIVIL right it is still a RIGHT. Actually its a CONSTITUTIONAL right.

2016-04-03	Kasich says..."Kids will spend less time focusing on [Justin] Bieber and [Kim] Kardashian and more time focusing on how we elect presidents,"      this is how I see it shaking out....Paul Ryan will be the nominee and Kasich will be the VP pick      so here we got somebody that hasn't campaigned, has not won a single primary and has recieved absolutly no votes as the nominee      the person who has won the most states and has recieved the most votes gets completely shut out      I'm not exactly sure that's a positive message for the kids about the election of presidents
2016-04-03	I won't take a chance on those two weirdos. Before I will vote for either of them, I will stay home that means that I won't vote for anyone including the local positions which really matter and Hillary will win and it will be Eddie Munster and Goofy Boy who will be at fault.

2016-04-03	It will never happen because there would be riots in the streets. I still believe Trump has this because it's just to late to stop him. Even if he doesn't get a plurality he will be so close they will have to give it to him.

2016-04-03	This loons wife bankrupted a college, sooooo crap weasels just who is exactly going to pay for all of the "free" shit is promising?      When Jane Sanders was in charge of a small private college in Vermont for seven years, it sank deep into debt while trying to expand its campus. Many students took out tens of thousands of dollars in loans to attend, but their investment was questionable: Only a third of former Burlington College students earn more than the average person with a high school diploma.

2016-04-03	When colleges all over the US are in the same terrible position, this is sadly far from unique to Jane, or Vermont, or the college she was trying to help. This is why the college has no hard feelings towards Jane, try as you might to find them, and Vermont voted over 90% in favor of Sanders. Keep at it though!

2016-04-03	First off, it is not "Texan Cruz" it is " Canadian Cruz" who was voted in ,with dual passports, as a senator residing in Texas. Jump right off that band wagon and pay attention.   The only thing more scary than Cruz and his bible thumping compadres, hoping to turn back the hands of time by about 60 years, are the morons who support him.
2016-04-03	Willber Fishbein you do know that Cruz is going to push NAU on us right? Google Heidi Cruz, read all about it. There will be no America, no rights for citizens. I don't think that is what GOD had in mind for us! His father says Ted is annointed KING to rule over all nations & to take all our sinful money... world dommination... I cannot vote for someone like that!
2016-04-03	Just out of curiosity, is there any lie that Trump could make up about his opponents that you *wouldn't* believe if he repeated it enough times?
2016-04-03	Canadina Ted didn`t renounce his Canadian Citizenship until 2014. He must have been countinf=g on the Candian Government benefits all Canadians get regardless of where they live. they draw both the US and Canadian Benefits. Like to lknow who paid for his education and what Nationality he attended Clollege as. Quite similar to Obozo, similar to what Obozo did. Did Obozo attend College as a Kenyan or Us Citizen.

2016-04-03	Trumpf is once again being treated unfairly, very unfairly. Just ask him.

2016-04-03	In 1860, Sen. William H. Seward (of New York) went into a contested GOP convention as the heavy favorite against 4 Republican opponents. None of the 5 had enough delegates to win the nomination outright. Seward had the most delegates after the first ballot....but it was a relatively unknown moderate politician from a Midwestern swing state who won the nomination after 3 ballots...that man was Abraham Lincoln.      Seward did not whine and pout about the loss, or threaten to run as an independent, even though he had he most delegates after the first ballot. Abraham Lincoln went on to become perhaps the greatest President in American history.      Mr. Trump (and his supporters) could learn a thing or two from this example!
2016-04-03	There were no primaries back then. It was all done at the convention. Not a fair comparison!
2016-04-03	Your votes. The man's hubris knows no bounds.
2016-04-03	More nonsense from Donald Trump. He wants to set the rules and define winning and losing. You know he's losing when he starts crying about other candidates taking his votes.

2016-04-04	That loud Ripping sound you hear is the GOP being Ripped Apart!   The DNC, Hillary, Bernie and Barack continue popping & eating popcorn!!   HRC/2016
2016-04-04	and the pledge by Sanders supporters to not vote for Hillary in the general election and write in Sanders name is just a clear presentation of a united Democrat party. Not to mention the compassionate way Bernie's supporters support Hillary by chanting liar every time she appears on TV.      The Republican Party is no more divided than the Democrat Party and neither are presenting themselves as a powerful party right now. I am an independent and far from right wing and it is clear to those of us who are not beholden to either party that both parties are dysfunctional and and fractured in ways that were never this alarming.
2016-04-04	Todd Smith   You're trying to compare what MIGHT happen to what is ACTUALLY happening and because of that your "Comparison" Falls Short!   Think About It   HRC/2016
2016-04-04	Todd Smith There is just no comparison at all between the Republican and Democratic Parties anymore, and incidentally you give the game away when you say "Democrat" Party. The GOP is dead. Stick a fork in it. After Trump, it's simply not a viable party. Either it's going to have to completely restructure itself, or just go the way of the Whigs and maybe we'll get an actual principled conservative party in its place.
2016-04-04	Every which way the GOP turns they are way behind the times. When you have NC Governor Pat MCCory signing into law hate legislation and the opposition to it you would think the GOP would get it but they do not. This only adds to the dysfunction of the GOP.
2016-04-04	Olympia Snowe says **Donald Trump is damaging the Republican Party brand. This party is truly split when your front-runner with a large delegate lead and who is seeing voter turnout records is said to be damaging the party. It seems the establishment GOP is desperately trying to "restore" the party to its pre-Trump glory. But restore to what? In my opinion the Republican party is still the party of large corporations, big banks, lobbyists. The same that saw Bush tax cuts followed by unfunded war and the great recession.

2016-04-04	Kevin Cunningham Probably won't happen but what would it mean that the GOP establishment and delegates choose a third person such as Paul Ryan? Certainly that would reinforce the assertion the GOP is not a true people's party but a party controlled by small established groups. The Republican party is between a Trump and a hard place.

2016-04-04	50 years from now, political historians will debate the hows and whys of the GOP's death.
2016-04-04	Can you back up your assanine statement with anything to support your incredibly naive views? 50 years from now Historians are more likely to be discussing how passing Obamacare eventually killed the Democrat Party. Now I could leave my statement right there like that too and just like yours it is meaningless becasue I have not provided anything to substantiate my position.      Come on Ramses, you clearly stepped into the box but no softballs are coming your way. In an educated and well thought out argument present your case. Just know I will shred whatever you post. Based on your previous post I might turn it over to my 11 year old son because I feel confident he can dispose of anything you will post.
2016-04-04	Todd Smith You're simply wrong - and it's rich that you talk about well-thought-out arguments and not throwing softballs; all you've said here is that Obamacare is the "Democrat" [sic] Party's epithet, which is asinine. Meanwhile the GOP has painted itself into a corner by pandering to, exploiting and fomenting the racism and bigotry of its base, since the very demographic shifts that freak them out also ensure that the "Southern Strategy" doesn't work anymore. But there was nothing to stop a bloated blowhard like Trump from swooping in and taking the game over from them, and playing it better than they ever could, precisely because he doesn't HAVE to care what happens to the GOP. So he can wreck it by making the base show its true colors more boldly than they ever have, thereby turning off the rest of America to that whole Klan rally.
2016-04-04	Todd Smith Somebody actually possessing the big intrllect you think you have, does not resort to childish name twist games like "Democrat Party". Obviously it isn't that you are just into brevity, or you woud refer to your train wreck of a party party as the "Repub. Party". You would probably be ahead if you just turned everything over to your 11 year old.
2016-04-04	This only exposes how out of touch the GOP and particularly Evangelical Conservatives are with the REAL world.   They live in their enclosed, secure media bubble, and just like the citizens of North Korea, they only know what THEIR powers-to-be tell them. The problem is what they're told is all lies, and their religious leaders have no power, have but how would they know, they only know what they've been told..... by those who have no real power.....
2016-04-04	You freaking liberals crack me up. Only 24% of the country self identify as liberal, it is your beliefs that are out of touch with the real world. At least the whackos on the right recognize they are nuts, you crazy idiots on the left just cannot grasp that you are the ones who are the most despised voting bloc in the country.
2016-04-04	Todd Smith Most progressives do not seek your endorsement nor your approval.
2016-04-04	Ha! Hillary and Obama both were against gay marriage just a short while ago. Bill Clinton was responsible for DADT (a horrible piece of legislation that was not only anti-gay...it went further to advocate the persecution of gays in the military!)   Consider that gay marriage when put on a ballot for voter consideration only passed in a couple of states. California even voted no a few years ago! Most of the gay marriage laws were passed by courts then of course SCOTUS sealed the deal (and many Constitutionalist, including Scalia who wrote the dissent, strongly believe that SCOTUS overstepped their boundaries) Be mindful that this post is not about my support or non-support for gay marriage (I happen to not care one way or another) but PLEASE...you libs ALWAYS pretend that you have the majority of opinion on your side when nothing could be further from the truth.   *Like Obamacare that Todd pointed out.

2016-04-04	Yes Senator Cruz is big on supporting women. So big he attacks Planned Parenthood based upon fake videos made by David Daleiden who he himself was indicted in his own scheme. He attacks women's right to choose without exceptions of the women's health, rape or incest. What a guy. Yep he supports women as long as he can dictate how they behave, what contraception women can use, and that women are not in control of their bodies. Ted Cruz is. Next he will decide what position is the best way for women to have sex. What a guy.
2016-04-04	Truly on top of that, it only adds to the GOP's attitude towards women. All one has to do is look at Governor Scott Walker's position against women and guess what? It is the same as Ted Cruz's a/k/a Mini Trump. Truly the GOP is out of step on women's issues and these two men demostrate it perfecty.
2016-04-04	Nothing fake about the videos
2016-04-04	Ric Rham they were fake, they got 4 people killed and 9 wounded at a Planned Parenthood Facility in Colorado Springs and David Daleiden was indicted with his own scheme.

2016-04-04	If the issue is to get delegates in the GOP after the caucuses and primaries have been concluded and the winners announced, there is only one conclusion that can be made. That the GOP caucuses and primaries are a big waste of time, and money. For example, Donald Trump wins Lousiana, however Ted Cruz walks away from the State the actual winner because he was able to convince more delegates to support him than the Trumpster. Yep makes sense.
2016-04-04	I'm confused, isn't Trump going to make the best deals, deals like you've never seen? If he can't make favorable deals with the GOP - in a situation where all the rules of engagement are a simple matter of public record - how is he going to handle Putin? Iran? After destroying America by ceding American interests to Russia, will he whine that Putin was unfair? Or the argument he used last week about the wife drama... "not my fault, they started it!"

2016-04-04	Bob is not bright enough to see that the establishment and the media are trying to steal the results from Trump. It's called corruption and the establishment and the media has been doing it for decades. Trump is trying to stop it, and we have folks like "Bob" who does not get it.
2016-04-04	Zodi Yabadoo The CEO of National Enquirer is buddies with Trump, as well as has endorsed Trump. It's pretty hard not to see a connection.
2016-04-04	If I learned anything from watching Trump, it's that the only way to rally a group like the RNC to you like he continues to say they should.... is by calling them idiots continually!
2016-04-04	Trump is just being honest. They are idiots and corrupt. What you rather have someone who is honest or someone who is lying and saying everything is great and we need to continue on with how the country has been run for the last several decades?
2016-04-04	Carl Harris Oh I agree, I would much rather have someone who is honest, and that person is 100% not Trump. He's the biggest liar of the entire bunch running for President.
2016-04-04	So if 'the delegates' wanted hium, Ryan would be happy to oblige?
2016-04-04	no. He's not ready, like Rubio. Only one Speaker of the House has been elected President. James Knox Polk.
2016-04-04	Paul protests too much, just like he did when he was being conisdered of the Speakership.
2016-04-04	He didn't want it either but was rather push into it. Don't think he wants to be president at this time.
2016-04-04	Political Theater 101...   Remember this:   Ryan doesn't want to be speaker   01/23/14   SAN ANTONIO — Rep. Paul Ryan said he does not want to be speaker of the House, a declaration that will cause reverberations in Republican leadership circles in Washington. During a wide-ranging luncheon in a hotel ballroom here Thursday, Texas Tribune editor-in-chief Evan Smith asked: “Does Paul Ryan want to be speaker?”   Story Continued Below      “No, he doesn’t,” Ryan replied.      Source ...See More
2016-04-04	So what? Ryan stepped forward when the party needed him to. Whether you support the Republican party or not, that's the kind of leadership you should be looking for. I believe he honestly did not want the speakership, but, did what was asked of him. The party is better off for it.
2016-04-04	Michael Rehkamp wow. You are either gullible or naive. Or both.
2016-04-04	Michael Rehkamp so you are admitting the horrorshow that your Party has become, where you are basically going to drag a piece of work like Paulie Ryan into the race kicking and screaming whether he wants to or not " For the good of the Party" ?   I fully understand. if Trump was looking like he was going to be MY candidate, i would be doing the same thing.
2016-04-04	I agree with his thought, if you want to be president then run from start to finish. No one else should be considered other then Trump, Cruz or kiaish. Also, if it's impossible to win you should be booted out if you refuse to leave. The delegates than are divided equally.
2016-04-04	Hope it Kasich or Cruz.
2016-04-04	He'd have to run on his "accomplishments" as Speaker - Cleveland, I think you have a problem
2016-04-04	Imagine if you held Obama to the same standard.
2016-04-04	Bo Poppa We did, that is why he won twice! Silly Republiclown!
2016-04-04	Bo Poppa Yes, Obama who graduated Magna Cum Laude Harvard Law and was elected President of his class' Harvard Law Review, Obama who worked on Wall Street and was a private-sector lawyer for years before becoming a State Senator and then a US Senator, Obama who was a Constitutional Law Senior Lecturer and was offered Tenured Professorship at one of the country's best Law Schools,      The same Obama who pulled together the team that beat not only Hillary Clinton's Teams, but John McCain and Mitt Romney's teams as well, and successfully ran both 2 BILLION dollar Global Enterprises, his Election and his Re-Election Campaigns.      Obama, who will be revered as one of this country's best Presidents ever. Yeah, THAT Obama.
2016-04-04	The fundamental disagreement is that Clinton wants a debate viewed by as few people as possible while Sanders wants a debate seen by as many people as possible.
2016-04-04	You can do it Syracuse! All New York, New York Women for Bernie Sanders & #feelthebern support you! This was the first time, both the Syracuse men's and women's basketball teams were in the Final Four in the same season. Syracuse women meet UConn on Tuesday Night at 8:30 p.m.   DNC & Clinton wanted the debate when the Syracuse teams were playing!      Syracuse Women's Basketball moves on to the National Championship game with an 80-59 victory over Washington yesterday.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BClp0GoKA      Thank you Syracuse Orangemen!

2016-04-04	Adam Sinclair debates have not hurt Hillary one bit. As front runners always do, she is not quick to help Bernie out with free air time. And the loser is desperate to get free air time. Nothing new here.
2016-04-04	Cheryl Onstad New Yorkers are proud that both the Syracuse men's and women's basketball teams were in the Final Four together in the same season for the first time and made New York basketball history. For Clinton & the DNC to think a debate when Syracuse is playing is ludicrous.

2016-04-04	Screw him, he just wants to bitch. HIllary is not required to debate Bernie at this point. Pick the 14th or 15th or GTFO. Enough.

2016-04-04	It will be an absolute disaster for the party if they DO nominate either Cruz or Trump.      Carson is dumb as a box of rocks.
2016-04-04	It won't matter if Hillary or Bernie win their nomination, the GOP is facing a disaster with Cruz or Trump. I worry more about Kasich who polls well in a general and can pretend to be a moderate
2016-04-04	Stick to helping kids, Uncle Ben. Politics is not your thing. Laterz!
2016-04-04	The real disaster, Mr. Carson, is that an absolute majority of GOP primary voters happily accepts the choice between a raving lunatic and a creepy phychopath.
2016-04-04	The party of Honest Abe seems hell bent on dragging us back to the 1860's...
2016-04-04	I'm confused. Who is the lunatic and who is the psycopath? It seems that Trump and Cruz are both.
2016-04-04	I hope Sarah Palin's name is thrown in the pot. I need a good laugh.
2016-04-04	That would be hilarious
2016-04-04	He'd be a decent candidate; I do think given a wide variety of factors, to strain toward it, or to calculate your way into winning it at this late juncture would be distasteful. That said, if there were to be a natural deadlock in the convention process, he's a possibility. You have to really ask yourself whether it's acceptable to postulate a candidate who ran not at all, when three of them are going to go into the convention with some delegates. But, we'll see. I think some of this is insider wish-fulfillment. Best case scenario for a Ryan nom: there is a consensus among deadlocked delegates that the primary process didn't work this round, and that the state of the party is somehow in the balance, and that the resulting choices are simply not competative in November. That's a narrow band, but it isn't impossible.
2016-04-04	Remember the nickname, "lying Ryan,"? He's a cotton puff when having to be honest. Honestly doesn't become him and people pick up on his lying very quickly. He'll be toast.
2016-04-04	Mahir Baig - Scam spamming on comments forums are the work of bed wetters.

2016-04-04	Well he's not crazy, so that's a start. But it would also be the death stroke for the GOP since the base would rebel and sit this one out. Let's all be honest. The GOP should just sit this one out and try to rebuild for 2020. They've already lost 2016 through stupid obstructionism and in-fighting,They are literally not capable of governing anymore since the base that created refuses to allow them any degree of compromise despite the fact that we have a two party system.
2016-04-04	Look at his budget proposals and tell us again how he is not "crazy". The man lives in a world of fantasy fiction.
2016-04-04	He wants to voucherize Medicare...and make old deal with pre-existing...he is just as crazy...crazy with a pretty face.
2016-04-04	Timothy Counts Agree. Ryan is a right wing extremist who does not care about common workers and normal American folks. He is in office to enrich himself and his party bosses.
2016-04-04	We could have a sheister 'businessman', a theocrat or the former WeinerMobile driver who's been sucking the government tit ever since he left the only legit job he had - one that his mother got for him, I might add. Think I'll go with Bernie on this one.
2016-04-04	Gothar Reichart Are you finished? then move along.
2016-04-04	Gothar Reichart your rant doesn't make Wayne's comment any less true... Ryan HAS been paid by taxes his whole life... AND the only job he's ever had was a Weinermobile driver that his mother got for him... the one so dedicated to ther beliefs here, is you.
2016-04-04	Gothar Reichart lol we then you can count out every single trump supporter I know.
2016-04-04	Most of Ryan's wealthy supporters are going to be very busy doing damage control after the Panama leak.
2016-04-04	Maybe his mother can help out, just as she got him the job as WeinerMobile driver.
2016-04-04	ah, we could only hope...........
2016-04-04	Gothar Reichart This is why people despise conservatives. You're too stupid to be outraged at what's really wrong with the country because you're so fixated on whining about things that aren't.
2016-04-04	Anybody who has not run for the office this year, gone through the rigors of the trail, should not be drafted to parachute in. That denigrates the taxpayer expense and votes of millions of people. Moreover, saying Ryan is the least "establishment" is demonstrably false - he has never had a real job. He graduated from college, went to work on the Hill as a staffer and then ran for Congress. He's been there ever since. He grew up on the teat of Mother Congress and the establishment. What's the point of saying something that is just a lie? This dishonesty is precisely what has gotten people so mad about Hillary Clinton on the left and the republican establishment on the right.
2016-04-04	Excellent analysis of a crappy presidential "wannabe" who could take his "vouchercare" substitute plan for Medicare and put it where the sun doesn't shine.

2016-04-04	Do know what the rules of the Republican primary process are?      You don't think Trump running hasn't denegrated enough people already?
2016-04-04	HA, even Sanders knows that among his base are disrupters and violent anarchist. His is the only campaign among any that got a special tag "Bernie Bros and Bots" by the national media for their behavior.      His is the only campaign that has its voters disrupt other rallies, planned and surreptitiously executed by the campaign, the only campaign that has been caught stealing other campaign's records....the only one described as tea party of the left.      BERNIE VS TRUMP SUPPORTERS https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBHu7LsKiwiYViR230RtsCA      HE KNEW THIS VOTER BASE would riot against Trump. Alternatively, a recent study showed Hillary's voters are the most happiest and positive among all candidates voter base. Keep it classy bros and bots!
2016-04-04	ah hahahhahhaha.      The people across the way are having a drunken orgy, so you decide to move your family to a new location for your picnic.      ...and somehow you and your family are "disrupters and violent anarchists"?      Ah hahahaha...Your cognitive dissonance is strong.
2016-04-04	Also...      People riot against Trump in the same way that intelligence "riots" against ignorance.
2016-04-04	lol...oh man. It's so creepy there are people like you out there.
2016-04-04	Where is Sarandon? She needs to get out there to WI. Slacker.
2016-04-04	The multi-millionaire is busy telling hourly wage earners to vote for trump and forgo $13/hr. wage hike vs. $15/hr. Hillary suggested as something congress could pass.      Per the moron's logic; the revolution would be better " later" in 2020, by getting a fascists, racist, anti-woman Trump elected in 2016. This is how fucking convoluted Bernie’s voter base are...ALA dingbats and teabaggers of the left.
2016-04-04	Jay Majumdar OK, Jay. You've earned your money from the Hillarybot campaign. Now you can go pick up your paycheck and go home. Give it a rest. Hillary Clinton is a disaster in waiting.
2016-04-04	Steven Beliveau I would say she is no more a disaster than any of the remaining candidates. They all have baggage.
2016-04-04	Here is the difference between a Sander's rally and Trump rally, and its clear why the two shouldn't be near each other:      http://www.vibe.com/.../free-hugs-project-at-donald.../      At a Trump rally, if you aren't brainwashed to give your first born as a sacrifice towards the Trump altar, you will get threatened with a "punch in the face". Also, don't try to hug anyone. The world is a bitter, evil place, where love is dead. No hugs allowed. Only hate and fear please.      At a Sanders rally, if you where a shirt that says "free hugs", you will get lots of free hugs, and even find other people who are wearing a similiar shirt. People are happy and optimistic about the future, and no one gets threatened with violence for not being a Sanders fan. (Although you will have your opinions questioned, so be prepared to back up your opinions with logic if you can.)
2016-04-04	Paul Estrada      The difference is that Bernie supporters aren't violent. The violence is from Trump supporters, since ignorant people tend to speak with their fists because their intellect can't keep up.      Every violent incident in this election was a Trump supporter being violent. Not a Bernie supporter. Not a Cruz supporter. Not a Rubio supporter. Not a Hillary supporter.      I doubt you can find even one video of a Bernie supporter throwing a punch, but I can easily find 10 videos of Trump supporters being violent.      Actually, here are 12 examples of violent Trump supporters:   http://www.slate.com/.../a_list_of_violent_incidents_at...
2016-04-04	Paul Estrada      Your video assumes that everyone who hates Trump, must be a Bernie supporter.      Most of the country hates Trump, so why isn't Bernie currently winning in a landslide?      Derp.
2016-04-04	Paul Estrada   He is clearly standing in a place that supporters Bernie, not Trump. I guess you are willing to overlook your bias because it supports your opinions.
2016-04-04	Smart. I would worry about the safety of people attending the event if there were Trump people close by given the events of Trump rallys. I don't regard this as a time or place that a stand needs to be made against Trump, so it is just better to be separate and peaceful.
2016-04-04	Wise given the kinds of people Trump attracts. They come to do more than just listen.
2016-04-04	Trump is no idiot. He surely understood what Forbes is saying a week ago. He surely knew that it was time to calm down in order to attract the additional delegates that would put him over the top.      But still, Trump went out there last week and incinerated. What does this say? It says that Trump doesn't have the self control needed to sew up the nomination.      When his campaign manager was charged, he couldn't control his ridiculous outbursts. The reporter might have had a bomb in her pen?      Then there's Trump's 2nd favorite activity (after vulgar tweets): Shooting from the hip. Trump stepped in it at least 4 times last week by speaking without thinking: Twice on abortion, once on the Geneva Convention and once on nuclear proliferation.      Face it Trump supporters: Your man doesn't have the self control needed to expand his support and to win the nomination.
2016-04-04	Trump is NOT a seasoned politician who has dealt with issues in depth. This lack of experience does not bother me, it will come with the 'office'. He is also thin skinned, that will be the downfall of his candidacy.
2016-04-04	Yogesh Gupta      You have no problem, YG, with a new President who doesn't know a thing about any important national policy issue?      Heck, I'd say that Trump's lack of interest in learning is almost more of a problem than the lack of knowledge itself. Example: With the possible exception of immigration, there is no hotter issue in the GOP than abortion. And 9 months into the campaign, Trump has thought so little of that issue that he can't avoid last week's off the cuff land mines? That shows serious lack of commmittment to learning issues.      I can't agree YG: I don't see Trump learning quickly in office. He's not interested in learning policy.
2016-04-04	David Kent   Do you apply this same thought to Obama, whose grasp of foreign policy is negligible? Or HIllary? Who is inept? Memorizing capitols and the names of leaders is swell, but it gets you only to break-even. Insight and vision are harder.   I think none of these three people have what it takes.
2016-04-04	So I guess if Trump gets the delegates to win the nomination, Forbes will support him as well. Truly this says more about Forbes supporting a racist, bigoted, anti-semiite than it does about Donald Trump.
2016-04-04	He didn't say that.
2016-04-04	Mark Keeler the point I am making is that leadership should have disavowed Trump's candidacy a long time ago. Forbes represents a part of that leadership of the GOP and all he says is "if you do not tone it down you will loose the nomination"? What more can Donald Trump say. He is already damaged goods going into the national elections. So I guess the truth about women being punished for abortion as the position of the anti abortionist movement was too much but yet when Donald Trump stated that all Muslims would not be allowed into the US was not outrageous and acceptable? Even the GOP leadership does not know whether it is coming or going.
2016-04-04	"a racist, bigoted, anti-semiite"      Have you ever actually thought about your position or do you just regurgitate the headlines you read?      Trump is so likeable he got the crowd at AIPAC on his side and they had to release an official statement saying they don't support him because it looked like the crowd did by the end of his talk. Liberalism has soundly rejected reality in the name of identity politics.
2016-04-04	Forbes is missing the point that his key message is about bigotry and racism couched in economic and national security terms. How you tone down that hateful message to get a majority of Americans to vote for you is beyond my comprehension. Its his message that's the problem not the strategy.
2016-04-04	I would suggest that hateful as his message is, it is not the real problem. The real problem is the millions of American voters who actually believe he is something he is not, or can do things that cannot happen, and who will do whatever it takes to prove their/his point: lies, violence, internet trolling...

2016-04-04	Trump disparages those with training and expertise to justify   his ignorance. How can anyone accept that as a sign of   anything but intellectual laziness? He is selling ignorance as a rationalization for his lack of expertise in all areas.   This guy is a world class charlatan and the Republican underclass buys into his   justification of ignorance. It is abasurd to accept his contention that he will correct all of the world's   problems which have been created by the experts who have failed. Only fools could buy into what this guy is selling.

2016-04-04	Amazing how you could be so braindead as to think that Paul Ryan, a classic Tea Party favorite, is a RINO.   But then again, any supporter of Donald Trump either isn't a real conservative, or lacks any basic understanding of any of the issues at hand....
2016-04-04	Arthur Dent - well yes. He still has a lot of Tea Party in him, but he's become very RINO in his handling of his current job thusfar.
2016-04-04	LOL....the GOP can't get out of its own way. They hate Trump, they hate Cruz, but are stuck with both of them...and only them.
2016-04-04	Yes and the dems are happy with an old anti wall street nut socialist and a soon to be inmate in the federal pen? Sure, yeah right.
2016-04-04	Carl Skornik Neither Trump nor Cruz can win the general election. Must be tough for you to accept. I take it you are pro-Wall Street? I'm voting for Bernie.
2016-04-04	Carl Skornik Very happy to vote for either. The GOP is doomed.
2016-04-04	It's a funny line to walk, because the notion is: Cruz has to be able to win the nomination coming in second place, but he's also recognized that he's probably not what the party means when it says they want to use the convention to nominate a "unity candidate."
2016-04-04	The only unity I can see in this case Chris is the GOP universally disliking cruz and holding their nose in their opposition to Trump
2016-04-04	Claire Smith Yeah, they're both making essentially an identical argument, but the logical outcome would be different in each case. I think the potentially new piece of information if Cruz is playing this game is: he's identified that the party is probably just using him to prevent Trump from winning on the first ballot, but not firmly committed to installing him on the second ballot, or at least he's trying to close that possibility by making it unreasonable. It's been a funny month, because everybody is agreed on creating the contested convention, but there aren't any clear theories on what should happen from there; there isn't this firm and unequivocal "so we can nominate Ted," it's substantially less defined than that. If there is a plan, it's not yet appropriate to say out loud.
2016-04-04	Cruz is correct: the Republican party is toast.
2016-04-04	Make America Great Again 2016
2016-04-04	Donald Stern I'd love to know what you think that actually means. Nothing made overseas in our shops? No trade with other countries? Start a war in the Middle East? Build a $35 billion dollar wall between the US and Mexico which will only keep Americans in, not Mexicans out?      Trump is a TV-made figurehead. He has no policies and no idea how to implement them even if he had some. His speeches are cliches and insults, nothing more. Is that 'great' to you?
2016-04-04	Donald Stern, the media and Koch Brothers and Mitch McConnell are doing their best to stop Trump. Stamp out McConnell and Koch Brothers now.
2016-04-04	Well if Trump gets the majority of the votes how can Cruz think he should win. Cruz wants to just change the rules or to make him nominee. As a republician I woulld never vote for Cruz. He is fooling the people convincing them how he is so prepared. Bull he just has a big ego. Yes Trump has a big ego but he has a lot to show for it. Cruz has nothing to show. He is trying to convince people all he did in the senate. He did nothing except trying to shut the goverment down. He needs to work with people and he can't. If you listen to Cruz now he is campaigning on stateme nts Rubio and Trump said in gthe last few months. He is using other canditates statements to make himself look good.
2016-04-04	Scot, pull out the rule book ( off the internet) and read the actual words. If not a majority, you have to hit the magic number of 1237. Period.      And I agree with that AS THEN THE GOP IS PLAYING BY THE RULES THAT THEY SET... 1237.
2016-04-04	Cathy Williams But how can you give it to the person that comes in second. Cruz's own words to Rubio coming in second doesn't make you a winner.
2016-04-04	Scot Lori Colt Again, READ THE RULES. It all comes down to how the delegates are apportioned, and how they become unbound with each progressive ballot at the convention. And because Cruz has a good ground game and Trump's campaign is inept, many, if not most, of the Trump-bound delegates are Cruz supporters. That means that when they become unbound in the second and third ballots, they will change their vote from Trump to Cruz.   Again, IT'S THE RULES. IT'S HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS. But I guess when all you listen to is whining, stupid, loser Trump who doesn't accept that he is losing, you can't comprehend that there is a way that Trump lost that was actually fair and square. It was literally all there for him to do as well, and he was just too stupid or inept to capitalize on it.
2016-04-04	Kasich is the ONLY one who can beat Clinton.   But it seems that GOP voters are more interested in whinning than winning.

2016-04-04	Kasich gives me the runs.
2016-04-04	If the RNC rule of minimum 8 primary states wins is valid, Kasich should get out, since he can not reach this treshold. Trum won 212, Cruz won 9, so they are in. Kasich won one (1) and should continue running only if he honestly believs that he can win additional 7 in the coming primaries.
2016-04-04	The 8 state rule was only put in place to keep Ron Paul (Independent) off the ballot at an RNC event. Every convention's rules are set specific to it's individual needs, by delegates and a commitee therein.
2016-04-04	Untruthful, well most of them are, some of them, well actually they are true, but they are negative. Does anybody actually believe the nonsense this guy spits out?
2016-04-04	Nice misquote
2016-04-04	Casey Hoerth I don't know Trump might have said it. I hope he didn't, because that wouldn't be good if he did. Terrible, okay? I'm not saying he said it, who knows? All I know is what I see on the internet. See how easy that was?
2016-04-04	Kind of like 'hope and change.'   i see a lot of 'bringing us together' after 7 years.   All politicians are liars, you just judge the pesonality. At least Trump talks about stuff n o one else will talk about.      Lets open the Overton window!   Let some fresh air in.   Lets end immigration or at least be more selective like Canada.(I think discriminating is another word).   And no more Muslims(unless they send a vid personally disavowing Sharia and Jihad). We are getting to critical mass here.   The wars in the middle east have been a GOP generated disaster, the average   Iraqi prefers the stability of Saddam...See More

2016-04-04	The Pinocchio Test      The Sanders campaign is exaggerating the contributions that Clinton has received from the oil and gas industry. In the context of her overall campaign, the contributions are hardly significant. It’s especially misleading to count all of the funds raised by lobbyists with multiple clients as money “given” by the fossil-fuel industry.   Three Pinocchios
2016-04-04	As long as you don't consider Hillary Clintons Super Pac as part of her campaign that is valid. If you consider a Super Pac for Hillary Clintons campaign as part of her campaign then that is not valid. It's intresting to see all these Democrats coming out in favor of Money in Politics, I think I am in the wrong party,
2016-04-04	Hillary is a proven liar, Linda
2016-04-04	I guess this works if you can delude yourself into believing that people don't expect anything in return for going to the trouble of raising millions of dollars for a candidate.
2016-04-04	Vermont charges more than five times as much for community college than does California. Why hasn't Sanders been able to achieve a political revolution in his home state?
2016-04-04	If he was the governor your statement would be a good one to make but as a member of congress it makes no sense to put that on him
2016-04-04	Lmao. ..California is in debt up to its ears. Wow...another troll Hillary account. How much does she pay?
2016-04-04	Angel Rocha - Why didn't he run for Governor then so he could have worked to get free tuition for students in Vermont? Or couldn't he have become a leader in the state legislature? Vermont is probably the most liberal state, yet California has a higher minimum wage.
2016-04-04	Now we have Clinton's chief pollster calling the good people of Wisconsin, that vote for Sanders, racist simply because they are white and don't vote for Clinton. Is there no low that Clinton will not stoop to to try and dupe people into voting for her?
2016-04-04	Hugh Johnson Hillary is a racist, Hugh
2016-04-04	Roy Ellis so untrue
2016-04-04	Where did he say that? Pointing out that she polls better among Latino and African-Americans is not racist. Maybe you should check your white male privledge if being represented by a canidate with minority support is so terrifying to you.
2016-04-04	just the fact that she WANTS money from war mongers, oil tygoons, banksters and CEO's tells you Hillary can't be trusted to put people the first. Check out her records for cripes sake!
2016-04-04	Where are BS tax returns?
2016-04-04	Same lobbyists represent renewal energy. Failing to admit that is being dishonest. It's cherrypicking data, which is sadly, something Team Sanders now regularly does.
2016-04-04	Barbara Daugharty he was literally asked yesterday for the first time. There is no bernie sanders tax scandal. I want you to think of how much energy you are putting into this when he releases them and it shows nothing. You can disagree with the guy but do you really think he is has some dirty secret hidden in his taxes?
2016-04-04	Bernie needs to win 67% of every election going forward by 60-40 margin. Every state he fails to do so, increases the margin and win % exponentially. http://www.nytimes.com/.../trump-clinton-delegate...      Even if Hillary loses 50% of all states going forward, she will still win the pledged delate race (does not include super delegates)      Many have predicted that 20% of Bernie base will riot when Bernie loses nomination. They are the left's version of tea baggers, full of conspiratorial stories and have Bernie's tactic support for them to riot.      Hillary needs only 20% of Bernie youth voters and she will easily have over 70%. Meanwhile Bernie needs over 60% of Hillary’s voters (over 30 + minority). Over 50% are hardened voters and will not vote for socialist
2016-04-04	His wierdest mistake was to make his attempt to convert superdelegates so public. That's going to make them less likely to switch. That "strategy" is much moreintended to keep his supporters encouraged than any actual attempt to turn superdelegates. He'd have to pull into a 3 digit pledged delegate lead over HRC to even make the bulk of them think about it.      The "whoever won a state should get that state's supers" argumet is dumb too, and if he really believed it, he'd be pressuring Elizabeth Warren to endorse Hillary Clinton then.
2016-04-04	You think her supporters won't vote for Bernie? LOL They will vote for anyone with a "D" next to their name. Luckily, he strongest supporters are in states that don't matter in the general.

2016-04-04	Tom Fitzpatrick no Tom, an example...I will wait

2016-04-04	Matthew Crawley   Support for same-sex marriage has steadily grown. Based on polling in 2015, a majority of Americans (55%) support same-sex marriage, compared with 39% who oppose it. See the latest data on same-sex marriage.   http://www.pewforum.org/.../graphics-slideshow-changing.../      Forty years after the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Roe v.

Another 18% have no opinion, the highest level of uncertainty Gallup has recorded on this question in trends dating to 1989. at 73 percent of women disapprove of Trump and a Reuters poll a week earlier found that fully half of female voters have a “very unfavorable” view of the New York billionaire.   http://www.gallup.com/.../majority-americans-support-roe...

2016-04-04	Noticed the teleprompter in the above photo of Trump. I thought those were against the rules of Republicanism as Limbaugh et al have forever mocked the president for using them. Got to admit Trump sounded much more articulate in that speech. Usually it's just off-the-cuff bloviating about his wealth, his businesses, and the size of his organ. Limbaugh must be mortified.
2016-04-04	Trump is worse then a babbling idiot . He did a town hall without a teleprompter in Phila. He sounds like a machine gun.   They tried it out during the 2012 election cycle . It was a failure from the start. he was back with the teleprompter within a week.   Anyone can sound perfect reading a teleprompter or repeating a memorized written speech.

2016-04-04	OK - so if no Sanders supporters agree to support Hillary, You'll be OK? In late January, the number of Bernie supporters who said "Never Hillary" was 20%. Only six weeks later, that number rose to 35%. It appears to still be growing as more and more Bernie supporters are hooking up to discuss where their votes should go: Write in Jill Stein, Bernie Sanders, or skip the election.

2016-04-04	Sander's $44 million to Clinton's $15 million grassroots.   One thing is clear, if the DNC is serious about the interests of the democratic party versus the interests of their appointed queen, it's time to jump ship.
2016-04-04	Hmm lets see she's raises 15 million for them in this quarter alone compared to the 0 he's raised for them! This isn't hard at all let's go for the independent senator who doesn't give a single shit about down ticket elections.
2016-04-04	Tye Moore She didn't raise $15 million for them, she raised $15 million THROUGH them. The money goes to her PACs and such.
2016-04-04	Seb Williams Wrong. Hillary has raised money on behald of other Democrats, helping them to get elected.      Bernie says 'we'll see'.
2016-04-04	So she raised $35.7...compared to his $44 million.
2016-04-04	The $15 million through the Hillary Victory Fund can't go directly to her campaign -- that's illegal. It goes mostly to her PACs, and some to the DNC which is supporting her.
2016-04-04	Seb Williams The Hillary Victory Fund is a bribery scheme. It mostly funds the campaigns of her Democratic super delegates who have pledged themselves to her.
2016-04-04	So if elected his goal is not to govern, it is just not to be boring. This guy defines being an idiot.

2016-04-04	Michael Larrea Are you in middle school.... pussy ass....definitely the last time I heard that was 7th grade.
2016-04-04	Yes, because its all about entertainment when running the country huh Trump? This is all a big game to the clown.
2016-04-04	Obama's been partying with celebs/elites, golfing and vacationing for the last 7 years, moron :-)
2016-04-04	Michael Larrea : ... and thrusting his boots deep inside your rectum.
2016-04-04	Michael Larrea...Obama has been doing no such thing and has taken 1/2 the vacation time as Bush Jr did. ALso, this isn't a reality show...running the US is real life, moron
2016-04-04	i hope he realizes the presidency is a "boring" job in the sense that you need to be calculated in what you say as your words carry more weight than anyone else on the planet. It's also one of the most thankless jobs you can have because no matter what you do 25-50% of people in the country will be against you for it.
2016-04-04	Obama's been very bored golfing for the last 7 years, oh and those $45,000 a plate fundraisers suck not to mention the non-stop vacations. You're a DUMBFUCK :-)
2016-04-04	Michael Larrea Speaking of being a dumbfuck....I'll bet your teabagging ass wasn't complaining when Bush spent 60% of his time clearing bush in Texas, just like your simple ass hasn't complained that your tax dollars was spent paying Republican Congressional members for sitting on their asses not doing shit for your worthless ass. Perhaps that's why you have so much time on your hands to puke up BS bagger talking points. STFU, lemming.
2016-04-04	Michael Larrea you're an idiot obama has taken the least amount of vacation days of any president since carter. not only are you stupid but you look like a poor mans version of jim rome with your dumbass goatee

2016-04-04	Stop.
2016-04-04	Makes sense to me. I work for a Fortune 50 (not 500) company, and we have pay zones based on the local market. Some places are simply more expensive to live than others. $15 an hour in New York is different than in South Carolina.
2016-04-04	Agreed. Let's get a $15 national floor, then places like NYC, parts of CA, etc. can raise theirs even higher.
2016-04-04	Brian Cairns Why not make it $500 an hour? Then everyone can be millionaires!
2016-04-04	Exactly. I've been saying that the entire time. Cost of living and location must be taken into consideration. Making it $15 in poor areas may hurt small businesses. $12 would make more sense. Not to mention that the GOP has refused to even consider $10.10. Clinton is 100% correct in her thinking. She could probably get $12 pushed through ($15 has zero chance of passing with a GOP majority in congress), then leave it up to states/counties decide if they want to raise it to $15.
2016-04-04	How much money did the Clinton Foundation promise Cuomo the governor?
2016-04-04	Do you have proof to back up that statement? No, then you got nothing! Suck it up buttercup!
2016-04-04	if he really wanted to, Cumo can buy out clintons -- that's the reality
2016-04-04	Another baseless accusation. How original.

2016-04-04	Too bad but Walker does not have the brains, guts or the balls to run again. He's scared for his family, and cannot handle the pressure.

2016-04-04	Van Hollen looks like a racist to me.
2016-04-04	Well obviously you can look into a man's heart, you must posess super human powers you fucking moron :-)
2016-04-04	Really? Do you have any compelling reason to think so or you jus feel that way? I am black and I have no reason not to like him. I will be voting for him.
2016-04-04	Abdulai Bah He's not racist, but he was willing to sellout to republicans. He was negotiating a deal to cut Social Security (remember the Simpson-Bowles report). Also, as a black person, why do you think that it is that blacks make up 25% of the democratic party, but only 2% of the democratic senators, and 0% of democratic governors? Obviously race plays a largely negative role for black candidates, and there's nothing wrong if black people decide to vote against that kind of exclusion.
2016-04-04	Racial politics/Race-baiting/Liberalism are all synonymous

2016-04-04	Maryland is one of the most democratic states in the country, and it's about 50% minority. However the Governor is white, the 2 Senators are white, the Attorney General is white, the State Comptroller is white, the leader of the Maryland Senate is white, and the leader of the Maryland House is white. And all of those positions are filled by white males except for the senate seat in question here which is filled by a white woman. And who have white democrats decided is best qualified to succeed her, yet another white male. White males are only 25% of Maryland, but if CVH wins, they’ll totally ...See More
2016-04-04	So point to one thing all these white people have done or passed that hurts the black minorities in the state. It is one thing to question equal representation but to question the character of these people with no evidence is childish.      Would you like me to call you racist because you are saying these things? I guess your point would be better made that white men in Maryland have better access to money so they can advertise more then a minority counter part.      The examples you use make it sound like Maryland is some aparteid state where black people rights are all stripped and they are kept down. It sound sort of crazy when you take what you said in a historical context.      This race thing has been and continues to be very silly.
2016-04-04	These Clinton votes counts are meaningless. It doesn't include anybody who votes in caucuses, most of which went massively for Obama (just as they're going massively for Bernie now). In the case of 2008 that also includes Michigan and Florida, where Obama wasn't even on the ballot... in short, 33 contests to 23. Yeah, no, she didn't win in any sense.
2016-04-04	Representation is fine, quotas are a disaster. Voting for her because of her skin color is just as racist as voting against her because of her skin color. She is asking for black racism.
2016-04-04	yeah yeah, vote for me cause i am black blah blah blah
2016-04-04	As opposed to "don't vote for her because she's black". That worked really well for Republicans in the past two presidential elections.
2016-04-04	John McCarthy ..... NO Republican EVER said anything like that... and you know it. But liberal tyle like to lie about such things.

2016-04-05	The question was unfair, "IF abortion was illegal, should someone who breaks the law be punished?" "Uh ... yes." Then all hell breaks loose because the average sheeple hear "should abortion be against the law?"

2016-04-05	Trump was actually EXPOSING what he and Republicans really think: PUNISH WOMEN for making their own healthcare decisions. The GOP is furious that Trump put the TRUE GOP stance on abortion out in the open for the whole world to see. This is just another example (of many) of Trump showing his DISDAIN for women and showing that he is UNFIT to be POTUS.

Of course it is the women already getting punished because she is exercising her constitutional right. She is faced with waiting periods, forced ultrasound, and traveling long distances to receive services from a clinic many miles away because the laws have closed clinics near by.

2016-04-05	Glad to see this bloodied, badly beaten up lady is recovering from the broken bones, bruises, and conussion from hitting the floor! Surprised to see she is able to walk and talk!
2016-04-05	Yeah, that's not even the point. The point is, Lewandowski clearly grabbed her by the arm and forceably moved her from her path; then Trump and his campaign trashed her and continue to trash her, all while lying through their teeth. Was Lewandowski meaning to hurt Fields? Doubtful. But fact of the matter is, she was walking nearly stride in stride next to Trump, in front of a Secret Service agent and he didn't remove her. That's his job, not Lewandowski's. Donald's assertion that she "grabbed" him has also been disproved with photos of Fields tapping his wrist with the back of her hand, in all honesty it looked like he may not have felt it, it was that light.
2016-04-05	Phil Lisi, this twit will milk (no sexist insinuation intended- lol) this for all it's worth!! Next up, she'll claim rape!!
2016-04-05	Like most serial abusers, you don't bloody up the women you beat, right? You just punch them in the gut and tell them to say "they fell" when the bruises are shown. If there's no blood, then you didn't really hurt them right?
2016-04-05	I've watched the video a dozen times. Hard to see where anything as severe as she is claiming took place. I think her pride was hurt more then her body.
2016-04-05	She was clearly grabbed by Lewandowski. Did she nearly fall, perhaps, but the video (as is the nature of security cameras) cut out a bit. Either way, it doesn't matter. Trump and his campaign have spent weeks trying to shut Fields up, and the simple battery charge only added gas to the fire. You Trump supporters are so blind and sensitive to even the smallest bit of negative coverage, which ironically is showing who the real Trump is, and by continuing to support him, it shows who his supporters are, though it wasn't difficult to tell.      The time for Trump's Train to come to a screeching halt has come.
2016-04-05	Well, you have the video, you have the audio, you have two eyewitness reports. You must not be very observant.

2016-04-05	What an EXCELLENT WAY to eventually unify the party, well done Haley! Definitely keep it up, it's not like there's a general election to worry about...a general election where we'll need the "delusional 19 year olds" to prevent Drumpf, or just as bad, Cruz, from being president. Not to mention the many millions of others, including myself, who are neither delusional NOR a teenager.
2016-04-05	If the shoe fits wear it and yes at this point in the game there is a lot of delusional going around.      Also if you want demcorats to respect you stop attacking the party and the front runner with republicans talking points and not the whole truth on many things.      Bernie people start doing that you might get some respect until then you are acting as a hostile take over and will not be accepted as a democrat.      Basically maybe some of you should think about making your own party and see how it goes. trying to use the democrat party to go extreme left will not work nationwide in the primary.
2016-04-05	Adam Rothstein Sorry, maybe I can insult minorities and women over 25 as you and your ilk have. Would that make you feel better?
2016-04-05	Wait....so Sanders hated super delegates and accused the DNC of all types of stuff....but is now planning for a contested convention based on the will of the people? So far, more "people" have voted for Hillary.      I thought Bernie was a "good guy"...but I'm starting to see him as something different. It seems like his motivation has changed from "his message" to "him".      Anyway. I think he will easily take Wisconson and Wyoming. But lose NY by at least 10 points, and Maryland by 30.      Once NY goes, that pretty much ends it. He would have to bank on taking Cali by +30 points to get back in it.
2016-04-05	Mark Hendricks...Hillary is way up in Pennsylvania too.
2016-04-05	mark hendricks - sanders has always been an a*hole and voters are just finding this out. not one of his colleagues in the senate has endorsed him. these are people who interact with him every day - so that should tell you something. sanders is a purist - there is notroom in his mind to compromise. the presidency is all about compromise - there is no black and white, Can anyone possibly see him on the world stage. He would be an absolute disgrace and laughingstock - an embarrasement for the U.S.
2016-04-05	Kelly Lacroix Bernie will also lose in WV and KY by large margins.
2016-04-05	Delusional old fool! He might take wisconsin by 1 or 2%, an it won't be enough to get him a head of her. Then NY is hers. And if he was by some mircle able to get NY, it wouldn't be by enough to do him any good. He'd have to take every state left by 49% to contest her lead. The further he falls behind, the more delusional this old man gets. He couldn't even remember Walders name the other days at the Rally, an called him Mr. Scott instead. Your can tell he's getting wore out an crankier by the day. He don't look so goood most days.
2016-04-05	NcCole - At this point, he is ego driven. After being ignored his whole life, he finally has an outlet for his meglomania and all those yuuuuuge rallies he's holding are feeding that ego. He doesn't want it to end. and anything he can do to hurt Hillary and the democratic party be damned. It's all about him and always has been and now we are finally seeing his true colors.
2016-04-05	Sanders needs 58% of the remaining delegates to just pull even with Hillary. Yes, he and his campaign are starting to show their true stripes.
2016-04-05	I noticed that. He only talked about it after Hillary publicized the issue. He's enthralled with himself like he's the ground-zero #BSBro or something.
2016-04-05	Foreign Policy, clear plans, 30 million dollars raised by HRC for down the ticket races... I will only vote for a Democrat not a parasite who used the party for fundraising and Press... Let Bernie take his Brand back to Vermont... Contesting the Democratic convention is a final insult. he has eshewed the Democratic party at every turn...
2016-04-05	Why do you need to be attached to a political party? They are both corrupt and hold dinners that cost $10k to attend. Even if you have views that match a party, being a zealot to them only serves to divide this country. No one is made better by having a D or R next to their name.
2016-04-05	Tony Adams He should've run as an independent if he felt that way.
2016-04-05	Robert Schrader - You are not familiar with the modern political system. It is almost impossible to get on all ballots as an idependent. American politics is rigged for the two party system.
2016-04-05	So a Dem might win Utah... Mizz and now Miss, if Trump is the Rep nom. Wow...
2016-04-05	Obama won 365 Electoral Votes in 2008, HRC might win 400 EV.
2016-04-05	Hillary Assad lmao so what would your preferred response to Gadafi using artillery shells against peaceful protesters??? and your response to Gadafis impending civilian massacre in libya? U know the UN security council signed off on that right?
2016-04-05	Hillary Assad -- LOL... That seems to be big plus in MS....
2016-04-05	If she's that close, Bernie would handily beat him there. Every person that voted for Hillary in the primary would vote for Bernie over Trump in the General Election. Difference is, Bernie would get a lot more independents and they are who determines the winner (in addition to an enthused base). If the polls don't reflect that for Bernie in Mississippi right now then that's just because they are still unfamiliar with Bernie Sanders. The Clintons strategy of keeping people in the dark about Bernie really paid off. They cut the number of debates down from 25 debates in 2008 versus Obama to only 5 debates this time around versus Bernie... That is until Bernie demanded 3 additional debates.
2016-04-05	Delusional.
2016-04-05	Please tell us how Bernie can beat Hillary, in the primaries he's no match now you're telling us he will beat her in the general elections?   The reason Bernie beats Trump over Hillary is because he had never been vetted nationally , once you're the front runner it changes the game. Carson was better in the general elections but once he became the front runner he was vetted and dropped out.   Kasich is another one, anytime he becomes the front runner or the nominee he's vetting will start and he will be exposed.   Bernie has never been the front runner so nobody thinks he can win and he has never been vetted.
2016-04-05	Yeaaahhh, clearly the person who is handily losing the Democratic nomination would do better than the person who is handily winning, because logic and facts right?
2016-04-05	It will be such a WIPEOUT if the Trumpdumb wins the nomination! Hillary w 400 EV. Thanks Donald! Please continue...
2016-04-05	Hey didja come up with dat gem, Trumpdumb, all by yourself? You sure is clever, and at least you capitalized his name, good boy.

2016-04-05	Jon Bond Have you noticed the names on all these scams. I know it sounds far fetched but I think it is meant to suck them in for isis to see who is recruitable.
2016-04-05	I was looking at some state level general election polls yesterday, and I was shocked how weak Donald Trump would be. He would lose Utah, North Carolina and some other traditionally Republican States. Cruz's map looks very traditionally Republican, while kasich will potentially win Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and possibly even NY
2016-04-05	No.   That Cruz map does not reflect his lack of appeal to either moderates or women in a General Election, and Cruz looks like a dirtbag creep to most women. Both Trump and Cruz have a huge problem with them.      Obama beat Romney with Women by double digits, 55-44% I can't think either one is going to be more appealing to most women than fit, handsome, moderate, good father and husband Mitt Romney.
2016-04-05	Ed Johnson Amen. I'd rather look at Trump for 4 years than Cruz.

2016-04-05	For what?
2016-04-05	Ed Johnson      Thanks for the humor today!
2016-04-05	“I respect the opinions and beliefs of every woman," she said. (Unless they happen to either be sleeping with my"husband" or have been sexually harassed by him, or sexually assaulted by him. Then i will do everything I can to destroy them.) "The reason why being pro choice is the right way to go is because it is a choice and hopefully a choice that is rooted in the thoughtfulness and the care that women bring to this decision. So of course you can be a feminist and be pro-life."      And if you believe she believes that load of bullsh*t, then I will sell you the Alamo and the San Jacinto Monument.
2016-04-05	Dan Cline You missed the point. She says she respects the opinions of all women unless they cross her and interefere with her drive for power, then they are ripe for destruction.
2016-04-05	Michael Bryant lmao you are bugging out man
2016-04-05	Roger Ramjet He is using the Tu Quoque Logical fallacy which is anappeal to hypocrisy. It is an informal logical fallacy that intends to discredit the validity of the opponent's logical argument by asserting the opponent's failure to act consistently in accordance with its conclusion(s).
2016-04-05	Someone should ask her whether she thinks unborn ducks, unborn alligators, and unborn deer and squirrels deserve the protection the law currently affords them.
2016-04-05	Honestly, I imagine enough middle of the road, regular republicans, will be repulsed by their party's 2016 situation and rhetoric and end up quietly voting for Hillary. I always thought she had something for everyone. U know you've hit the sweet spot when the liberals say you're a republican in sheeps clothing and the conservatives say you're a leftist Obama shill.
2016-04-05	Never happen
2016-04-05	She softens...instead of barking she might growl.

2016-04-05	This is from a guy who has begged for republicans to put forth an immigration plan, especially considering the apparent frustration they have with illegal immigration, and I can't find one plan, maybe you can direct me to where I can read it! That's why trumps ridiculous Wall plan has any traction in the first place, no alternative! Point is focus on why the GOP isn't doing anything before you criticize the person who IS doing something!

2016-04-05	Actually, it's pretty damn solid. And far, FAR more than obama is doing about illegals

2016-04-05	In Hebrew, the name Satan means “the accuser”. And the Bible describes him as the accuser of the brethren or the saints of God in Revelation 12:10, “For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night.” The Devil is sometimes, shockingly, behind a pulpit and spewing forth false gospels as he appears as an angel of light, yet he is the father of lies (2 Cor. 11:14)
2016-04-05	Now that world has discovered what a real Bi___h she really is she wants to put the genie back in the can and everyone forget it ever happened. Don't work that way with veiwers that use to watch Fox News. She belongs reporting for Huffington Post.
2016-04-05	Nice looking woman, making hay while the Trump shines. I frequently leave the TV on FoxNews after O'Reilly and am amazed she is so popular, given her habit of being unprepared for interviews. It is often obvious she knows little about the subject being discussed; and has featured a Trump hit piece on most of her shows since the first debate. Hopes "it will stop" ? Are you kidding?
2016-04-05	I agree 100%. Exactly my same feelings
2016-04-05	"Unprepared for interviews."      So says Journalism Expert Dean Williams of Crestview, FL.
2016-04-05	LOL he's going to lose DC by 50-60%
2016-04-05	Going to get involved with Politics you should do a little research into the Candidate before posting, Hillary is sinking fast, And it has nothing to do with Opinion its the 40 years of Corruption that People are actually starting to look at. But like you there are some that vote on a name, because they've forgotten all that had occured 10 minutes prior, Formal Education or Just Common Sense should tell you where she belongs-Thats as far away from OUR money or policies as she can get.
2016-04-05	Pedar J Kristiansen You made bro?
2016-04-05	Pedar J Kristiansen if you're going to wade into politics you should probably know the very obvious demographic challenge Bernie faces here. Also, you fail to realize that Hillary has yet to be affected despite people saying her campaign is crumbling for over two months. She's still winning, she's still the frontrunner, and sanders will not sway the same superdelgates he railed against just a few months ago.
2016-04-05	Glad he is on.   Next time get sigs, don't pay cash.
2016-04-05	Oh good... Part 2 of this non-story...
2016-04-05	Damn! DWS thought for sure she was going to get away with this one.
2016-04-05	It's a bit misleading to say, "because the city's Democratic Party submitted the paperwork for Sanders one day too late," because that is not the reason. They also submitted Clinton's paperwork late as well. Sanders was only taken off the ballot because a Clinton supporter filed a protest against Sanders being on the ballot due to the paperwork being late. The Democratic Party made a stupid mistake, but the real reason this is a story is because one of Clinton's supporters pulled such a cynical move about it.
2016-04-05	If Clinton's papers were late as well then why did we not hear about it , we only heard that Bernie wouldn't be on the ballot ? As far as that Clinton's supporter ,she really needs to stop the attacks and watch her tone :)
2016-04-05	Linda Rock We did hear about it, that's how I know about it. The question you should be asking is, as I pointed out, why didn't Politico mention it in this article?

2016-04-05	Soon after taking office in 2009, Obama and his secretary of state — who is currently the Democratic presidential front-runner — began pushing for the passage of stalled free trade agreements (FTAs) with Panama, Colombia and South Korea that opponents said would make it more difficult to crack down on Panama’s very low income tax rate, banking secrecy laws and history of noncooperation with foreign partners.

2016-04-05	wait...didn't the superdelegates decide who won in 2008?
2016-04-05	no
2016-04-05	At the end Obama had a 100 delegate pledged delegate lead with 1,800+ to her 1,700+. Neither had the number needed for to clinch in pledged delegates. Super-delegates are what put him over the top. Clinton could essentially clinch as soon as she reaches 2,383 which may or may not come before CA, unlike Sanders she's not trying to rip the Democratic Party apart because she's losing.
2016-04-05	Roy Carl YES they did as neither   Hillary or Obama had the full amount of Pledged Delegates   (Obama was ahead by 105 but   did not even have 2,000. Try   Researching the FACTS before   Giving a stupid incorrect answer   Are you a GOP Troll or Sexist   "AynRandPaul" Libertarian as   ANY true Progressive or Dem   WILL Vote for the Dem Nominee...See More
2016-04-05	She must have forgot 2008 but that's ok because I don't doubt Hillary won't have the 2383 needed come 6/14 at 7pm in DC.
2016-04-05	No, she didn't forget 08. Obama led in pledged delegates and he was the nominee. Pretty straightforward.
2016-04-05	Good luck for Bernie because he needs 67% of the remaining Pledged delegates to get to the magic number. After running an "us against them" campaign if he wants to go to the convention depending on the "them" to get him accross the finish line he is in for a rude awakening.      Even if he won 67% and Hillary won 33% she would still hit the magic number as well.
2016-04-05	President Hillary Clinton. Get used to saying it!
2016-04-05	How about we do away with delegates entirely, and just move to a one person, one vote system. Whoever has the majority wins the nomination. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the general wins the presidency. Anything else is absurd.
2016-04-05	Absurd is a bit strong. There are arguments for and against the electoral college. A very simple argument for it is that the majority of the country lives on the coasts. What if a presidential candidate promised to give tax breaks (or some other benefit) that only benefitted those living on the coasts? He could completely ignore 75% of the geographic area of the country and still win. You think that's a recipe for civil discourse? I see regional strife writ large. Saying anything other than a popular vote is absurd is oversimplifying a layered issue. The founders were not idiots, maybe consider their reasoning for a second before jettisoning it?
2016-04-05	Start your own party and you can set your own parties rules. As far as the general election it will only take a constitutional ammendment, good luck with that.

2016-04-05	Terry Doe I am at a bar in NYC toasting Hillary not Ted or "Donnie 2 Times.". The place is packed with her supporters. There's a few Bernie supporters talking trash yet there have been of fist fights. Image that. It's just like a Jets v. Giants game. We New Yorkers can disagree on candidates and then unite and support either of our teams when then make it to the Superbowl. By the way, there was one Trump supporter wearing high waters & red cap who was ID and escorted out to loud cheers. Apparently, his baby fingers gave him up.
2016-04-05	why is goldmaker lying by saying cruz is ahead in all of the last 6 polls?
2016-04-05	because he, like most of the media world, is VERY anti-Trump.
2016-04-05	Because it's the truth, but I forget that you trump supporters are not used to hearing the truth from your candidate. That's funny that the media is anti-trump, he only gets 75% more coverage than any other candidate. Again the truth doesn't matter to you idiots!!!

2016-04-05	Play the Ted Cruzifix drinking game! Watch his speech tonite when he wins Wisconsin. After every applause line, he chuckles to himself. It is the weirdest thing ever--it's almost like he delivers his line and when it is met with applause, he's saying to himself, "They bought it!" and can't help having a little laugh in Hitlerian delight.   Do a shot every time Ted has a giggle...you won't last long.
2016-04-05	Winston Herzog if you took a drink whenever Trump said something coherent, you'd be on the wagon permanently.
2016-04-05	"Pass the popcorn" why do liberals always say this? It's the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard on these boards. Can’t you just hear the snarky, self-righteous, holier-than-thou, smug tone in their assertion? Get a life you freaks. While I hope Hillary implodes with the FBI investigations I would never say “pass the popcorn” because not only is it lame and childish, it makes you look like a fool.
2016-04-05	Why is Cruz publicly saying he wants Kasich out? Kasich helps Cruz. He siphons off TRUMP voters.
2016-04-05	That's delusional, once again a useful idiot repeating Trump lies!!

2016-04-05	While most of this site's visitors are obviously destined to be catapulted over to the wrong side of THE WALL, I do have a message for the very few actual adult, non-developmentally handicapped Americans who visit Politicommie: ONLY TRUMP 2016! Let the elitist garbage of the DNC/RNC (is there really any difference?) know where you stand and sign/share the We WILL Walk petition! ...https://www.change.org/.../chairman-reince-priebus...
2016-04-05	I am not surprised that this "political" operative is on Trump's (Drumpf's) team. He will be up for incitement in a wink of a demonstrator's use of an axe to enforce his Feurher's wishes.
2016-04-05	Linda Bracken thanks for the lead Linda
2016-04-05	Linda Bracken Without a semi-revieling profile picture I can not endorse your nomination.
2016-04-05	Nothing like a little extortion ...so classy!
2016-04-05	You don't think the voting public should know who is representing their vote? I do.
2016-04-05	Gene Gaudi Only if it's done in a way that does not place the delegates' safety at risk, or result in a sense of psychological intimidation. To have a group of angry people showing up at your door, mob-like, is nothing but intimidation, not to mention a violation of the delegates' personal privacy.
2016-04-05	Lisa Mona : if they vote as the voting citizens wished, they have nothing to hide. You think the cowardly approach, secret and hidden, is serving the voting public? not so much.
2016-04-05	These threaten delegates should make Justice Scalia proud and bring their guns with them so they can they self insure their freedom of speech and assembly. No need to fear Baby finger gangsters lurking in the hotel lobby.
2016-04-05	They might be able to bring their guns to their hotel rooms - only the convention center is supposed to be gun free.
2016-04-05	Problem solved, the delegates can pick off the trumpanzees, and then state they were in "fear of their lives" in the hotel lobby!      Trumpanzees always said, it would end with a 2nd Amendment solution!

2016-04-05	Every fact checking organization concluded that Sanders' accusations about Clinton and Fossil Fuel money were misleading and since Sanders had also taken money from individuals who work in oil and gay that makes him a HYPOCRITE and a LIAR.
2016-04-05	So there's no such thing as PAC's and lobbyists? Just keep telling yourself that.
2016-04-05	Steven Smith Who really cares if she gets money from Fossil Fuels, they fuel School Busses and Ambulances. It's like, an important thing........fuel. Plastics come from fuel, like your computer or smart phone...........

2016-04-05	Sanders will not be able to win without getting 60 percent of the votes in the remaining states and he will not win New York. At some point he need to recognize reality.
2016-04-05	Alex Meyer Truth, he's a broke loser, this is his retirement plan.
2016-04-05	Matt Potter" he's a broke loser,"      Because he's a Socialist.
2016-04-05	Leroy Jackson That's pretty much sums it up. He never had a real job til he was 40. Now he thinks he should be in charge of a giant Economy? LOL . Socialists by nature are supposed to be good at basic math, he couldn't even be a Socialist!
2016-04-05	Urge all people to read Sanders interview with Daily News. For one whose entire campaign is about Wall street, his utter ignorance was astonishing. I honestly thought it was from the Onion.
2016-04-05	Sherry Bural I agree. Sanders had no clear answers and doesn't seem to understand what powers he would or would not have as president. The comment I found the most disturbing was how he would have a 'more agressive' justice department which would look for illegalities on Wall Street. That's scary. SOunded like if he couldn't find any law breaking he'd make it up.
2016-04-05	Cheryl Onstad ... i wonder how that interview will play in the new york primary since it is a new york paper which lots of new yorkers read - i bet it comes up at the debate ..... sanders' ignorance on the issues he yells about most was pretty shocking to me ...
2016-04-05	Susan Banks He said " I don't know...." WAY too many times. The Pipedream Smoke is starting to dissipate.
2016-04-05	glad to see the paid Clinton shills have invaded the comments section.
2016-04-05	Nope , we are just hitting back at Sanders.   It's been kid gloves so far. It's time they come off.
2016-04-05	Karen Delph if sanders took off the gloves Clinton would get eviscerated. She's as crooked and deceitful as the day is long. Good luck digging up dirt on Bernie.
2016-04-05	What will you life become when the BS is finally over?
2016-04-05	For the record, the young lady questioning the secretary was NOT from the sanders campaign. She's a greenpeace activist.
2016-04-05	Hugh Johnson - I love to watch Dems attacking each other and trying to claim each others candidates are liars.
2016-04-05	Hugh Johnson Why would ANYONE have to tell lies about the Butcher of Benghazi? Simply telling the truth about her career of self serving greed and corruption should be enough to turn off all but you dyed in the wool Hillbots.
2016-04-05	Leroy Jackson why would anyone take you seriously? Go back to being a Chump For Trump!
2016-04-05	The fucking reach.
2016-04-05	Soon after taking office in 2009, Obama and his secretary of state — who is currently the Democratic presidential front-runner — began pushing for the passage of stalled free trade agreements (FTAs) with Panama, Colombia and South Korea that opponents said would make it more difficult to crack down on Panama’s very low income tax rate, banking secrecy laws and history of noncooperation with foreign partners.      the fucking truth
2016-04-05	her hands are dirty, and you just don't like it.

What evidence is there of that?      Are you saying that Clinton supported Panamanian privacy or tax haven laws? No evidence of that.      As best as I can see, apparently some are trying to argue that Clinton and Obama should be found at fault for supporting the Panamanian Free Trade Agreement. But I'd like someone to show me how the FTA did anything, one way or the other, to facilitate tax shelters in Panama.      Considerably more relevant, I...See More

While she can't fill 500 people at her rallies. This New York rally on the 13th right before the debate is going to be MASSIVE
2016-04-05	Bernie Thinks he Jesus... I heard he walks on water.      Always the smartest guy in the room, and always full of shît.

Seeing as you have the maturity level to stoop so low, especially considering some of the dumb things you have posted, It would seem to be a clear case of a pot calling a kettle black. Grow up.
2016-04-05	Bernie & the people are going to win this election, We are going to get corruption out of politics & I'm sorry to say that you as my representative's are on the wrong side of history. Support Bernie not corrupt Hillary or we will vote you OUT next time around! I have been a voter in Ct for over 40 years.
2016-04-05	No, no that isn't going to happen. April 19th is NY. April 26th includes Maryland, Connecticut. Delewhere, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. I bet Clinton takes 57% of those 631 available delegates.   360 vs 271. At that point, Clinton might be sitting on a 250 delegate lead with only 14 states left. Cali is the big one, which would be up for grabs (which means a tie benefits Hillary), and New Jersey is the other big target...which will probably go Hillary.      Clinton does not need to blow Bernie out down the line. She just needs to get through Wisconsin and Wyoming while keeping at least a 150 delegate lead.
2016-04-05	Mark Hendricks, you areally dreaming. Bernie haso been gaining while hillary is losing leads.
2016-04-05	Mark Hendricks Doesn't matter. While Bernie would be the more interesting candidate, neither is going to be president.
2016-04-05	Bernie's burnout begins. That interview with New York Daily News was shocking. Bernie sounded like he was half asleep. Hillary would have NEVER been so unprepared to answer issue oriented questions.
2016-04-05	....she never has answers though. She usually goes on and on about other stuff. Many times interviewers have to ask her questions many times but often give up.

2016-04-05	Hugh Johnson how do you know he is white, you ignorant cum sucker.
2016-04-05	Clinton was all about the 2nd amendment but now is for ludicrous gun laws. When has suing been such a hard on giver? If something is legal, why should the people that sell or make it be liable for someone misusing it? That is a really stupid thing to push for. Anyone with a brain should be able to understand that. Hillary and the people pursuing this are really just as stupid as people keeping women from getting birth control.
2016-04-05	Hugh Johnson   “I disagree with Sen. Obama’s assertion that people in our country cling to guns and have certain attitudes about trade and immigration simply out of frustration,” Mrs. Clinton told an audience in Indiana, according to news reports at the time. “You know, my dad took me out behind the cottage that my grandfather built on a little lake called Lake Winola outside of Scranton and taught me how to shoot when I was a little girl.      “You know, some people now continue to teach their children and their grandchildren.

2016-04-05	Trump has since corrected his correction and said his original answer stands. Hillary is right, as Maya Angelou once said "When people show you who they are... believe them the first time."

In Trumps case, I heard it and it was clear what he was saying. He just wanted to obfuscate more before it came out of his mouth. How do you turn that fact into an acceptable explanation?

2016-04-05	Neither Donald the corrupter, Hillary the corrupted, Ted the nattering nabob of negativity or Bernie the advocate for a bankrupt socialist ideology will make America great again.

2016-04-05	If Republicans hold open primaries how can you say those with the most votes should get the nomination? What you are doing is counting non-Republicans into the mix which is helpful to know, but not when it comes to that candidate accepting and following the party platform. Democrats and Independents can favor a candidate on free choice when Republicans favor the opposite. Its really up to the national convention to sort all this out in the end.
2016-04-05	Well at least it's not as bad as the Party leaders declaring that the primaries are meaningless because they and not the people choose the nominee
2016-04-05	Here in Virginia you can vote either in the Democrat primary or the Republican primary but not both.
2016-04-05	Jason Griffin Then it should read; "We the Party leaderds;" instead of "We the People!" This all sounds like a conspiracy to do away with Mr. Trump's candidacy/nomination...Party leaders are serving THEMSELVES and not the average American seeking a proud, descent and safe country.
2016-04-05	These exit polls are confusing as hell. This one says they want the guy with the most delegates should get the nomination. so are they voting for Trump? Another exit poll from ABCnews says that 6 in 10 DON'T want a contested convention. So are they voting for Trump? That's the thing it's one confusing soup. People say one thing but may vote to achieve the opposite results.      Wisconsin is one confusing state.XD
2016-04-05	Even newspaper columnists are hard to follow sometimes because the written word is not always clear. Even at the college level it is evident kids are not exposed to writting compositions   This is why schoolchildren should be given assignments which include writing clear and concise usage of the English language from Grade one. Throw out Common Core and go back to the curriculum used 50 or 60 years ago when there was no dumbing down to accomodate foreign language students. Immerse them into the neighborhoods and into regular classes. They will learn the language much faster.
2016-04-05	It sounds as though they believe it should be settled on the first ballot: he who has the most votes wins.
2016-04-05	Marie Wake up! Do you really think polls are honest?No! They are not, they are rigged to sway your opinion, they use the same tactics when they release job reports and unemployment numbers. its all slide of hand and smoke and mirrors to make you feel safe and happy.
2016-04-05	There are rules in place. These were agreed upon long before the primaries started.      Alter them at your peril.
2016-04-05	If Trump isn't the one, then I hope Trump runs on Independent ticket to screw the Republican Establishment! He may be able to get enough votes from both Republican and Democrats and Independents to win. Screw the Party!
2016-04-05	Nope, sorry. There are no "rules in place," just rules they used last time (in 2012). Whatever rules they'll use have yet to be decided on.

Yes Snyder was Govenor, but you are letting the people escape culpability who are DIRECTLY responsible. Blame Obama. He was President.

2016-04-05	"WARNING: Early exit polls are incomplete, and they should be interpreted with caution. They only include interviews with voters who cast ballots earlier in the day, which could underrepresent certain groups. And the networks don’t release full results before polls have closed statewide; they only tease out certain numbers, some of which will shift significantly in the final survey."      Early exit polls analaysis is generally a waste of time.
2016-04-05	But they mattered when they said Bernie won't be Latino vote
2016-04-05	I didn't say exit polls don't matter. I said early exit polls are a waste of time. Also, I'm not sure what you're getting at.
2016-04-05	Dylan Stark Saying they are a waste of time is the same as saying they don't matter, are you that dumb? Yes you are.
2016-04-05	Well Clinton should win tonight.
2016-04-05	I hope she wins, it would stun the Sanders camp, but if nothing else considering how he outspent her in the state by such a wide margin, and Wisconsin basically being tailor made for Sanders, if Clinton keeps it close it's a victory for Hillary!
2016-04-05	Wayne Anderson Yes; there's little chance Sanders can make up much ground in the delegate race - he has to win BIG, especially BIG states, to gain around 250 elected delegates more than Hillary. He can stay in the race, whatever - he does have his $ to spend, have fun with. If he doesn't catch her in elected delegates - what earthly reason would a majority of superdelegates switch to him for? To be anti-democratic?
2016-04-05	Even if Bernie wins by a modest margin - it won't help him much in delegates - mostly a feel-good win for him. Gonna take lots of delegates to catch Hillary now.
2016-04-05	Sounds like they want Clinton then .. right?

2016-04-05	You know it would be really cool if political commentators like Nick Gass could get the political spectrum through their thick heads that liberal and conservative are just polarisms that don't do justice to our diversity, not just on social and economic issues, but on how we understand government and the limits to authorization to represent and act on behalf of others.
2016-04-05	The Alt-Right nut jobs prefer Anarchy
2016-04-05	Michael Kelly alt nuts might be better for us and the world than mainstream lunatics out there blowing up the world and giving corporations control of everything, then hiding their wealth in Panama. My point is that liberals are not progressives. Progressives tend to be socialist democrats. And libertarian communists are quite different from these. Neolibs like Trump and Hillary are more authoritarian and right of center. Paul Rand is further right than that on economic issues, but also very libertarian...what is being coined anarchcapitalists (really a contradiction in terms). Both the RNC and DNC are basically fascists in politics, economics and social issues. A good discussion starter might be the self survey @ politicalcompass

2016-04-05	Yes, and I'm sure that he'll blame all of them when he loses, instead of his vapid "policy proposals", ill-suited temperment, and racist rhetoric.

2016-04-05	Could not happen to a "better" group, they created this monster and now it is going to destroy their little kingdom. The GOP deserves what ever happens to them; their refusal to work with our elected President and the poison that is delivered every day by their conservative mouthpieces like Rush has created this situation. I hope they loose big in November and finish devouring each other in the aftermath.
2016-04-05	WARNING TO GOP CANDIDATES and ELECTED OFFICIALS:   (Local, State and National, future and present)   It's up to YOU to pressure the GOP Leadership to NOT overpower the vote of the people and select a candidate for the Presidency not chosen by the MAJORITY of primary voters.   They apparently will not listen to US - the GOP registered voter.   Be mindful that MANY OF US will change our Registration to "Independent" and CANNOT and/or WILL NOT vote for YOU in upcoming elections.   I suggest YOU do the same if they persist in this nonsense. . :-<
2016-04-05	Well since it looks like no one is going to have a majority of either primary votes or delegates I guess the GOP can do what it wants. And the trumpers can just piss off
2016-04-05	I call BS on you... for starters you would vote for satan your so damn scared of hillary. when limbaugh and hannity and the rest tell you to get in line and vote for there nominee ... you will... and you will vote happily. so get in line and shut up. your type have done all the other elections and still lose so get in line and shut up and get ready to lose again,
2016-04-05	A real Republican should have some idea of how their primary process works. From what I can tell 99.9% of them are just finding out, including the front running candidate....
2016-04-05	Just to clarify, If Donald and his supporters are cheated, this voter will vote against every Republican on the ballot.
2016-04-05	please do!
2016-04-05	no you wont.. .you will fall in line and vote for there candidate. you will vote for who they tell you to vote for. you been doing it all these years why stop now. so shut up and stop having a tantrum and get ready to vote for who they tell you to vote for.

2016-04-05	Can someone decode that into English, with punctuation please?
2016-04-05	What's with this paternalist ish in referring to Bordallo primarily as the "former first lady"? She was the lieutenant governor for eight years (not under her husband) and has served as Guam's sole member in the House since 2003. Even if comparatively Clinton has spent most of her public life as first lady to Bill (12 years in Arkansas and 8 years in the White House), it would be ridiculous if you did that to her.
2016-04-05	I hear all the time about how illegal immigrants are supposedly "less likely" to commit crimes than the native population. How can that be, when their existence in the country is a crime?
2016-04-05	Oh, God, that was so brilliant and original it's making my head ache.
2016-04-05	They are less likely to commit crimes in this country because they do not want to be deported.   The type of crimes Trump characterizes (drug dealing, rape) is significantly more destructive than what most immigrants are engaged in, that is finding a safe haven for themselves & their families. It was the crimes Trump described that they were trying to escape from.

2016-04-05	Carl, my son is an FBI Agent. He says it's impossible to tell how many and who in the illegal community commit crimes because they never use the same name twice. The DHS does not finger print them in most encounters. Until we get rid of the corruption in our government we will continue to have these problems.
2016-04-05	Stan Thompson ... They actually have crime stats that are very accurate. You know, besides FOX News. The connection between crime and illegal immigrants is a lousy myth. And illegal immigrants are the least of our problems. Mass murderers = extreme right white men. Oooooh FBI...

The same old system being manipulated by lobbyist money that benefits themselves and not the American workers.      There are many reasons why so many politically insiders fear the Don.   1.

No that is totally against right wing ideals. You love the military and war as long as you aren't the one serving. Cowards all of you.
2016-04-05	The truth ...   If you're legally here doing those jobs then congratulations. Your company probably still has under bid the project or Trump was given special incentives for hiring minorities to do the work. Either way, you have disrespected your employer for flying that discussing flag on his property.      Acts like that shows why most Americans don't respect your culture and why we want to build a wall and deport those here illegally.      I would have rather seen the work done by Canadians or real Americans. It is frightening to watch our jobs be given away to disrespectful A-holes..      Bring back our jobs and do away with special incentives. If you're legally here and capable of working then there shouldn't be any tax breaks or special incentives to hire companies to do any jobs in this country. The only people being discriminated against are the caucasians.      Trump for President
2016-04-05	"The only people being discriminated against are the caucasians."   ====================================      Many, perhaps most Latinos are Caucasians. See Cruz, Rubio, Desi Arnaz, and some 300 million more.      -Ramon The Caucasian Latino.
2016-04-05	So your idea of persecution means you cant run around shooting minorities or where minorities are jailed at will. You hate the idea of being on the same social level right? Let me guess, you're being persecuted for being "Christian" as well. Damn you're dumb.
2016-04-05	Juan Valdez Trump is for the American workers, fair trade deals that benefits our workers.

2016-04-05	Didn't This guy endorse trump? It should be obvious t everyone now if they didn't know before: Meet isn't to be taken seriously & doesn't care about this country if he was willing to have this guy as President
2016-04-05	Newt's advice isn't worth much. He never made the A team.
2016-04-05	Everyone knows Trump is going to be the nominee.   President Donald Trump is going to turn America schools/public offices back to God, he isn't going to lie to Americans (like our current President and Hillary), he isn't going to bow down in cowardice before our enemies, isn't going to let illegals get away with breaking our laws, isn't going to sell out our agriculture/manufacturing companies to foreign nations, ignore hurting American Veterans anymore, and will clean out the Washington puppet politicians who continue to sink America into $19 trillion in debt while our cities erode into civil war and entropy.   https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions   Next Mr. Trump will give a series of six - eight speeches , taken from his position "White Papers" over the next month that outline what a Trump administration would be like to make people more reassured, and I think it would give them a better sense of what the serious underlying policy components are.
2016-04-05	Donald Trump doesn't give a hang about you or anyone else, and could care less about this country and those policies. He's in it for himself and the attention he can get. So don't get yourself all excited.
2016-04-05	Mary Fiori Actually, the post couldn't have been written by Donald...it has complete sentences (sort of)...and it makes some sense (sort of).
2016-04-05	Apparently, Greg, not everyone has gotten the 'message'. How can any party nominate a candidate that, at best, has the support of 35-40% of its base? Shout and scream all you want, but that is the most support he has. When you couple that with his horrific disapproval rating (last I checked, it was somewhere north of 70%)...how can you realistically say that 'everyone knows..'?
2016-04-05	The path to the nomination is finally getting on Cruz Control.
2016-04-05	I am sooooooo happy, it's such good news !!! Go to hell, Killary supporters, you are traitors !!!   Ronald Reagan, loving memory was our best President since JFK
2016-04-05	About fifteen percent of Republican primary voters said that, if either Trump or Cruz wins the nomination, they will vote for Hillary.
2016-04-05	You would rather have an emotionally unstable scumbag like Killary The Fruitcake? She beleives in all seriousness she is Julius Cesar (Julius Cesar, Napoleon, what difference does it make and who cares ) How low does our White House have to go???? Then there are Trump and Kasich, both of them are maybe great candidates, but have 100% no chances against Killary.. I would take the Cruz's over anyTHING else in a heart beat. I love my country and constitution.. and Cruz's do to.. Is that ALL the guys have? Theocrat??? Shame on people, which prefer Killary   Here I got some useful information   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1fJwS_SWD8      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5rNExc_1U   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jriU_cPU9Vk   And Ted is willing to hire this guy as our next Secretary Of State   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwfzEDv56BA I amd damn sure, Eric Cantor will be a great Secretary Of State, definitely much better than idiot John Kerry
2016-04-05	Before this Republican Primaries I respected only three Wisconsinites: Clifford D. Simak, science fiction writer.

Another great Wisconsinite I have very big respect for is Jack Finney, a science fiction writer from Milwakee. And Ben,a good buddy of mine, he studies at the Portland State University. Now I respect every one of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump supporters from Wisconsin. Especially the Cruz supporters. I also damn sure, Donald's supporters mean well and understand how dangerous Killary The Fruitcake is, in that fashion, my respect for each one of them
2016-04-05	More Wisconsin primary voters said that they were enthusiastic about voting for Hillary, than said that they were enthusiastic about voting for Cruz, and Cruz won.

2016-04-05	I work 45 hours a week after going to school for 5 years to get my degree and can't afford rent, food, and health care (the one of the three I have to sacrifice to afford the other two, good work on that no public option "Affordable Care Act" Mr. President), but I'm just a Young Slacker for wanting to break the status quo Secretary Clinton represents and fights for. Right.
2016-04-05	Bernie is right on this. If guns are legal, suing gun manufacturers, unless they knowingly sell to someone or in someplace known to use guns for crime, is antithetical to law and legal precedents. It simply makes no sense, legally or morally. He wants to place the blame on the criminal, which is where it belongs.
2016-04-05	With the way Hillary thinks we may as well sue GM, FORD and CHRYSLER for all the deaths on the highway in this country

2016-04-05	Right or not....CT is going to be tough for Bernie.      Basically, Bernie is going to win easily in WI, and smoke HRC in WY.....and then....the end. NY is the 19th. MD, CT, RI, DE, and PA are the 26th.
2016-04-05	Bernie Sanders is 100% right. Should I be able to sue food manufacturers for making me fat? No. Their food may have been healthy, but it was my conscious decision to eat a lot of it because it was delicious.
2016-04-05	Is that what Bernie proclaims? GMO’s don’t have enzymes that let you digest your food. We should be able to sue GMO food manufacturers for fat, diabetes, pancreas problems, etc…      TO ME, the gun thing sounds more like Bernie’s supporters, THE REPUBLICANS! Smell the coffee. Look down at the ground Bernie in complete shame!
2016-04-05	Well I do very much have the option to go organic. However, my point being, by blaming the manufacturers you are removing a portion of the blame from criminals/committing parties in these atrocities. Are you saying that the people whole broke the law are less to blame than the companies that are simply profiting from a legal market that stems from and supports one of our constitutional rights? Are you saying that you feel that the actual murderer is not to blame here? But rather the person that makes an item that has neither the capability nor the consciousness to act without an outside party not only setting off a reaction but also aiming that reaction? And no, I am not a Bernie Sanders supporter. I am a constitutionalist libertarian. And this is simply a topic that mine and his opinions apparently align upon.
2016-04-05	Phil Bailey   If those gmos are causing those ills, the fault should lie with the politicians who coin terms such as "substantial equivalence", which allows companies to pump these products into us. If you don't know what that means, I suggest a quick Google. Food manufacturers only follow the rules put in place by the politicians they pay
2016-04-05	Team Clinton is really grasping on this issue. She's wrong on wages. Wrong on Wall St. Wrong on trade. The only thing she can think of to attack Sanders is an obscure law that has zero impact on crime.

2016-04-05	Too bad you didn't read the article and couldn't figure out they are talking about Judicial Watch and not the FBI. The FBI doesn't involve itself in FOIA request of other agencies.      It is truly astounding peoples lack of understanding about what is going on.
2016-04-05	Scott Henricks It happens. : ) I read the headline and assumed it was the FBI so I bashed Hillz and her aides and THEN read the article and deleted my comment. It's Judicial Watch! As much as I dislike Hillary and would never vote for her, I think her aides shouldn't give any answers to those clowns. Quash the subpoenas.
2016-04-05	Scott Henricks Like hell they don't. Obfusucating FOIA requests is a federal crime. That is the FBI's bread and butter.

2016-04-05	Cruz will never win the general election. He's just another radical right-winger that appeals to the Evangelical right, but not much else. I'm very happy that he schlonged The Donald. But if he wins the nomination -- which is doubtful -- he'll lose badly to the Democratic candidate. Time for progressives to celebrate. The Republican party is toast.
2016-04-05	I wouldn't write off any major party candidate. (Although I'd be tempted to write off Trump).      I don't think Romney was a better candidate than Cruz, and he came within a 2 point swing of unseating an incumbent president.      Hillary isn't an incumbent, is seen as untrustworthy by independents, has absolutely none of Obama's charisma, has serious problems with men as a voting bloc, and will have to fight the desire for a change after 8 years in office.      To say that Cruz couldn't possibly win against Hillary - especially if God forbid there's an economic downturn or another terrorist attack - is just a fantasy.

2016-04-05	Even though all the polls suggest he does better against the republicians than Hillary lets face it the republican party has destroyed itself this election im pretty sure both Hillary and Sanders would trounce them with how divided they are.
2016-04-05	You mean he wins white states like Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii (24% white), which are among the top most ethnically and linguistically diverse states in the U.S? You mean he wins states with open primaries like the general election? And earning the votes of Independents are suddenly "Repulican crossovers?" You've been duped by the mainstream/corporate media. He has won 7 of last 8 with either significant or landslide margins and has the momentum moving forward to win NY.      The facts are that Bernie has created excitement and has increased voter turnout in record numbers across a number of states, and has the appeal of young voters (8 out of 10) and Independents (7 out of 10), which makes Bernie the strongest candidate in the general election, not only as a Democrat, but also against any replublican nominee period.      http://www.alternet.org/.../dear-cnn-stop-erasing-people...

Now their entire plan is to win with superdelegates.      But its even worse that that. Bernie says over and over again how hes against the insiders and the rich who rig the system   for their own advantage, yet he has as his top campaign aide a insider's insider and corporate bagman and influence peddler. Think Monsanto lobbyist and Bernie' top strategist and campaign chief Tad Devine paying himself $850,000 a month might be a reason to keep the campaign alive even after its clear that Sanders cant possibly win?.      Btw, thats 35,000 people who each month give this Bernie Bro hypocrite their $27 bucks.      As Johnnie Rotten said at the last Sex Pistols show in 1977: " Ha, ha, ha. Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? "   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8mduTEvnU0

Its NOT an actual ad agency, Devine's firm is a tiny shop where a few insiders share the wealth of selling out to anybody they can. Look at his client list.

While you may think your better than others, just the first few sentences of your initial comments suggest otherwise.

2016-04-05	What about Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii (24% white), which are among the top most ethnically and linguistically diverse states in the U.S. Or does that not fit your false narrative? It's funny that the mainstream/corporate media (and Hillary supporters like yourself) only categorize a state as diverse ONLY if it has a significant black population and forget the fact that there are many other minorities that make up this great nation (and these groups are not monolithic I might add and there vote varies to some degree depending in the region they live in), in order to fit your false narrative by trying to downplay Bernie's message and achievements in this primary.
2016-04-05	Edmond Kulla It's just DATA, Ed. For the most part ( not 100 percent) Bernie wins the whiter states with open primaries and caucuses with a black population of 10 percent or less. That's just data. HRC generally wins ( not always) when the states are closed primaries and more diverse. That is not personal...it's just data. Bernie would do well to learn from HRC how to get the black vote, and she would do well to learn from him how to get the younger vote...and how to get people enthused.      I dont like it when we denigrate each other. ( i have been guilty at times as well)

2016-04-05	Bernie had a nice win tonight....gaining 8 or 9 delegates and will still be behind HRC more than 225, more than any lead that Obama had over HRC is 08. He will likely win Wyoming. But until he wins, NY, MD, and Pa bu huge numbers....15 to 20 percent, he can not catch up. Even if he beats her big in Calif. It's not personal, just math.

In other words, he will sell out as fast as the current GOP leaders have and support the Democratic agenda. Democrats are terrified of Cruz because they know he will not "pivot", he will stick to his promises to the voters and he will follow a real conservative agenda. They know if he is elected and the GOP keeps both houses of Congress, Obamacare is dead. They know all of Obama's executive orders are dead, the Iran deal is dead. In short, the entire Progressive agenda is dead.

2016-04-05	Trump cannot help himself. Acting like a 4 year old is as good as he can get to. "lying Ted and trojan horse" are not statements to improve his image. His loss is to his immature behavior and rude manners. Americans want strong leaders who can take a loss and get back up to fight again....not complaining that everyone else caused the loses .With his statement on losing to Ted tonight I am waiting with baited breath for his next stumble and it could come at any minute! Perhaps Ted can teach him how to behave like a grown-up and write like a man trying to become the President of the United States. I am starting to believe that he can't get it together so maybe we should just put out the call to Vote for Ted Cruz and end this misery!

2016-04-06	I find it amazing. Donald Trump is the most hated Repubican within the GOP. Ted Cruz A/K/A Mini Trump is the second most hated Republican within the GOP. Now the never Trump forces that should have been active months ago are now joining forces for a convention fight by throwing their support with Mini Trump. Loser 1 and loser 2. Both, are racists, bigots, and anti-Semites. They use fear and hateful rhetoric to make their arguments. Says a lot about the GOP.
2016-04-06	Lend Mahdrof LOL but you have Donald Trump facing elder fraught and civil corruption fraud, fraud in advertisement, looking at penalties of 40 million dollars in New York and possible racketeering charges in California. Then you have Ted Cruz, Mini Trump who falsified his financial statement where he got his money to run for political office. Not only that his father believes that his son Teddy Cruz is destined by God to become President of the US. Like the second coming of Christ. And you want to compare the two? Not such a difficult decision after all
2016-04-06	Lend Mahdrof.....what will you do? Why, you will lose the presidency, of course. Just like the last two times.
2016-04-06	Not a fan of Cruz, but I think the upshot is he's substantially more careful about what he says and how he says it. A lot of the animosity about Cruz is that he's a tad or very much unscrupulous in his execution of certain power plays, sometimes showing very little loyalty (apparently). That's not a admirable trait in a human, but it makes for less embarassing elections, and at the very least he's more on board with a consensus view of how the economy should work (foreign policy he's said some outlandishly aggressive things, but within general policy limits, up to a point; not "let's end our relationship with Saudi Arabia" or things like that). I will say this, if he wrestles it away at the convention, I'll be like, "Holy crap, you placed this bet last May, and somehow you were right."
2016-04-06	Wait until all of his affairs come out in public! Cruz is a tool!
2016-04-06	Yeah I'll keep waiting for that. Considering it's about as real as bat boy and the frog man that were both creations of the National Enquirer as well.

So now is he bending over and kissing the ring, or the back side of the Boss of Bosses.      You can trust the good Sycelian boys in New Jersey more then you can trust either political party.
2016-04-06	Cruz has always kept campaign promises in the past. He may need support now, but that doesn't change his character and his record of being consistent in fighting for Constitutional freedoms for 6 years. At least we don't have Clinton who has, on the record delivered favors for people who donate to her Foundation/slush fund. Look it up, she's very corrupt. But he has stood by principles even though he's not rich enough to self-fund. Cruz 2016!!!

2016-04-06	Ira Snowfeld Do you always parrot the lines of celebrity politicians? Or is this something special you have with the great orange one?

2016-04-06	Hillary Assad Secretary of State follows the orders of the Commander in Chief. We never invaded Syria or Libya and Bush was given authorization to go to war and chose to go under false pretenses. That’s why your statement was RUBBISH. Now I see why you only posted the same comments because you have no idea.
2016-04-06	Hillary Assad As you stated, "a plan"; it has never been implemented because she is not the Commander in Chief. The circumstances on the ground maybe totally different if or when she becomes CIC.
2016-04-06	Hillary has consistently held a +20% lead in Penn and one poll comes out at +6% and another poll from the same time frame has it Clinton +22%.      Yah I'm believing it is a single digit lead.
2016-04-06	Every poll in every state has shown Clinton with "insurmountable" double digit leads. Hell, 538 even gave her an 80% of winning New Hampshire until a few weeks before their primary. But in nearly every state (outside the South), Bernie has closed the gap and ended up getting far more votes than the early and even late polls predicted.

2016-04-06	College kid wanting a revolution for free things. The Democrat Party has always been the party of the people. Some people know who to get things done within the party- like Clinton, while others like Sander's haven't done much in the years he has spent in Congress. And, funny, he is an insider, part of the establishment, having been a Senator for many years, yet he lies and bills himself as antiestablishment.
2016-04-06	Margie Vogel The koolaid is strong with you. For starters, you sound like a Republican. Nobody is asking for "free" things, just better ways of doing things that enhance the quality of life of Americans and future of our nation. For instance, universal healthcare by opening up Medicare For All will cost a new payroll tax of 2.2% (poorest of the poor likely exemted or subject to refund), but this will save most Americans many thousands of dollars per year. If it works in every other developed nation, why not here? Why do we persist with a costly, deadly for-profit system? Oh yeah, Clinton is th...See More
2016-04-06	Margie Vogel "an insider, part of the establishment, having been a Senator for many years." That's an accurate description of Hillary Clinton.
2016-04-06	they are not most hated, Trump is MOST POPULAR. do the math or were you taught common core?
2016-04-06	Show us your math.      (Also, common core is great for teach math concepts.)
2016-04-06	Oh Diane, you are so funny in your state of denial.
2016-04-06	She's not leadership material. She knows what it looks and sounds like because she's memorized it. But every time a chance came for her to do it, she blew it. She's not up to it.
2016-04-06	Wrong. Further, for the record, here is what Hillary said: “There is a persistent, organized effort to misrepresent my record, and I don’t appreciate that, and I feel sorry for a lot of the young people who are fed this list of misrepresentations,” Clinton said. “I know that Senator Sanders spends a lot of time attacking my husband, attacking President Obama. I rarely hear him say anything negative about George W. Bush, who I think wrecked our economy.”      Hey Axelrod, she did NOT call Sanders supporters dupes – the word ‘dupes’ is not even mentioned in her comment. Hillary said that many yo...See More
2016-04-06	New York Daily News released its transcript of the editioral meeting with Bernie Sanders, with the editors asking serious and well thought-out questions about policy, and Sanders revealed that he is ignorant on a host of important issues (just like the GOP Presidential nominees) and he is in WAY, WAY over his head. It is painfully and embarrassingly clear from his interview with the NY Daily News, that he has empty slogans but no ideas with specific and detail solutions. Hillary is clearly more qualified and prepared to be POTUS than Bernie, Trump, Cruz, and Kasich.      http://www.nydailynews.com/.../transcript-bernie-sanders...      https://www.washingtonpost.com/.../9-things-bernie.../
2016-04-06	"She's not leadership material" . . . You are CLUELESS. Currently Hillary has more votes and delegates than ANY of the Democrat or Republican presidential nominees. Hillary is MORE qualified to be president than Bernie, Trump, and ANY of the presidential nominees, and she advocates policies that support women, all races, and all Americans: She has spent 8 yrs in the U.S. Senate on the Armed Service Committee, served on other committees on the budget, foreign policy, the environment, transportation, health, workplace safety, pensions, and children, families and the aging, she supports civil...See More

2016-04-06	If she'd had any brains she would have hired Axelrod immediately after she lost NH, and paid him whatever he asked. Plouff, too. THat was abad mistake on her part. Mook and Benenson are..... ineffectual, at best.
2016-04-06	Clinton will have a difficult time getting Sanders people to unite behind her if she insults them.   Someone please get her a copy of "How to Win Friends and Influence People"
2016-04-06	She didn't insult them. She said that Bernie Sanders is misrepresenting her and some of her policies and where her campaign funds are coming from. David Axelrod said that they were "dupes".
2016-04-06	Don't worry - I won't vote for her no matter what. I don't vote for war mongers.
2016-04-06	Brendan Connell So!!!! It happens every election year. Someone chose a different candidate. It will happen to Bernie, Trump, Cruz and everyone else who is running for office.
2016-04-06	She did not say they were "dupes". He should not have made that statement. Bernie Sanders is misrepresenting Hillary Clinton to people. However, we see in the Daily Mail interview that all he has is slogans and no concrete plans to deliver what he is promising to people. He is Trumpesque in the way he is running his campaign. On CNN last night when they did the math even if Bernie wins every state 55/45 and you don't include the superdelegates Bernie Sanders still will have less delegates than Hillary. We know she will win some of the upcoming states like NY and CA and more of the delegate rich states. Bernie Sanders can run as long as he wants but, he needs to stop lying and saying he has a path to the White House.
2016-04-06	No, she didn't use the word "dupes." But, that's what it sounded like to me. Not that she's wrong. Most voters (both parties) will vote straight party line no matter what. And that's the majority of voters. But, newer voters are looking for someone different. So, they grab on to the new kid in town (even if he's 74), but, don't really understand the issues or what it means to support a given candidate. I seen dozens of interviews on different networks talking to the people on the street and most can't even identify why they actually support their candidate.
2016-04-06	Michael Rehkamp Well then I heard something very different than you, because I heard nothing like that at all.
2016-04-06	Agreed. Bernie is being hypocritical, disingenuous, and LYING when he tries to pretend that he does not accept money from various groups, when he DOES accept money from voters, Wall Street, etc. The Washington Post gave Bernie 3 Pinocchio’s for lying. Per the Center for Responsive Politics, Clinton AND Bernie has received donations from fossil fuel workers and donors who have ties to the oil and gas industry. Bernie rails against Wall St. contributions and the Campaign Finance System, but he IGNORES the fact that he indirectly took about $200,000 from Wall Street firms and lobbyists through t...See More
2016-04-06	Clinton is the worst.
2016-04-06	pathetic! clinton has been on the wrong side of history time after time. Bernie has been on the right side of history time after time. How her supporters keep supporting her is beyond me. Low info voters. They are sucked in and DUPED by her network the Clinton News Network (CNN) which is owned by time warner and contributes to her campiagn. So it's their job to blackout Bernie or say negative things about him at the service of their obviously corrupt canidate. Go figure.
2016-04-06	Texans for Higher Order Thinking Skills Was Bernie on the right side of history when he was a part of the Socialist Workers Party, a communist group following the teachings of Trotsky, at 39 years old? A lot of us were kind of radical when we were young but this is kind of like W growing up when he hit 40 and deciding that it no longer made sense to go out to bars and cheat on his wife. Maybe it doesn't matter to younger people but there is a reason why he isn't getting much of the vote from people over 40. It doesn't look like a problem for him in the primary, but you can bet it would be in the general.
2016-04-06	Texans for Higher Order Thinking Skills From your post, Your name is absolutely LMAO ironic. Why? You're clueless And ignorant.

2016-04-06	And yet Bernie is still losing. She seems to be a lot more graceful than you are. But I've come to realize Bernie supporters, not all but many, are just vicious. How many are actually Dems, outside socialists, or even conservative activists trying to tip the scale is hard to tell, but this is definitely not a Democrat running against her.
2016-04-06	Mark Keeler good lord! I hope she would be more graceful than me. I am not trying to run for President. If she is not, then this is truly scary.      I am a registered Democrat, if it matters. I am also someone who has been fighting for families and poor people in the courts throughout this entire 2000's to present time period. I know what she has done because I have been one of the people that have to go in and clean up the mess. I know the votes that she made that were harmful and I know the votes that she should have shown up to fight against but could not be bothered. Again, BAPCPA pretty much is it in a nutshell. If you can't understand that, then you won't ever understand how she sells out the poor.
2016-04-06	Mark Keeler - Mark, you're absolutely right. This is not a Democrat running against Hillary and it's terrifically unfair how vicious he and his supporters have become. Apart from my unwavering, strong support of Clinton, I'm furious at the inept Sanders and the terrible disservice his dispicable campaign is doing to Hillary and to the Democratic Party. Still, I know that the math is with Hillary and that she will still win the Presidency!
2016-04-06	And if you believe anything Carpetbagger Clinton says, then I will gladly sell you the Alamo, the USS Texas, and the San Jacinto Monument.
2016-04-06	Your problem is that no one - absolutely no one - wants anything from Texas except for the state to stop sending morons (Louie Gohmert) to congress and equally stupid presidential candidates (Cruz).
2016-04-06	Sanders got it right in the interview about breaking the banks, its the jornalist who was mistaken, lol! Also, about how sure she is to be the nominee, since August last year she created a loophole with DNC for big donors, via her Vicotry Fund and bought the loyalty of 33 democratic states. You can find the article on this subject googling. As for if he was or not botch in the NYDN , I suhhest to read a paper on the Huffington Post onlinem that is very accurate and, the writer is not a pro-sander, just to notice.      Sanders is running for presidency and NYDM was asking him legislative stuff. Clinton scripted interviews would never ever be able to formulate a single try answer. Sanders knows the specifics of some issues, as his debates have proven it.      "Don't be afraid to vote for Sanders"!
2016-04-06	Sounds like you read the HuffPo article. Many others disagree with that analysis and that wasn't the only thing he said that got him in trouble. He blew it on everything from gun seller immunity to how to deal with ISIS.

2016-04-06	Your crazy!!!!! Lolololololol
2016-04-06	The article is right on! John Kasich can win the "general", and an experienced Presidential REPUBLICAN candidate who can balance the budget, and has international "smarts". (IMHO, Trump is not only dangerous and stupid, he is a Democrat & definately can not work well with others).
2016-04-06	Boy, I sure wish I was as stupid as Trump, I'd be a billionaire by now! He would not have the successful business if he could not work well with others. Maybe, just maybe you need to listen w/your ears and not your mouth before you spout off on something you obviously haven't thought thru. I get it, you hate Trump and want to do everything you can to smear him. But understand, Kasich has no chance of winning, & if he leap frogs over Cruz or Trump, there will be an uproar. Besides, why would Kasich want to be President knowing the people of the majority of the people don't want him and he stole an election. Not a good way to start out.
2016-04-06	Brenda Hartford ... & how can "you" want something, that you do not recognize as valuable. Kasich is too subtle for most people to initially "get"- he would be excellent in "diplomacy". Example; CA relatives said who is he" , recently got to to know KASICH, and then the response was: "like him for President".
2016-04-06	As a Republican I'd rather see Clinton or Sanders be president than see Cruz or Trump ruin the country. Kasich is the last reasonable hope for the party in 2016 and I'm sure as hell not going to be one of those that voted for one of the two idiots that cause a major economic collapse or world war or maybe even both.

Don't worry about closed primary, we tied among Democrats last night, and since I's could vote there was no reason for them to switch to Dem. We've made a good effort to have I's register Dem in the upcoming closed states.

IOW he has lost yet he is employing a scotched earth policy and damaging Dems all across this country in the process. We need to win the Senate, not feed Sanders ego
2016-04-06	Yeah, this is all getting annoying. If you factor in Washington, and an 80/20 Wyoming win for Sanders, he will still be roughly 210 delegates behind Clinton.      I expect a close Clinton win in NY and PA, and a pretty good Clinton win in MD. CT and DE are up in the air because like it or not, both of them are pro-business states. CT is full of insurance companies, and DE is a situs haven.      That block is worth over 600 delegates, so I expect Hillary to net about 45 or so.      After that, I expect Bernie to crush HRC in Indiana....but even a 2-1/33 point win will only net Bernie about 26 delega...See More
2016-04-06	Well put. Unfortunatly Bernie and his supporters are like W and do not believe in math. They use "fuzzy" math, deny reality, believe in utopia dreams coming true, live in an alternate reality. Sounds a lot like republicans to me.
2016-04-06	Indiana will go for Hillary all the way--too smart in Indiana, too well-educated to believe in dreams that are not reality--dreams are good when they can be reality, but even in the recent interview, Bernie admitted he doesn't know the first thing about what he needs to do to accomplish what he is preaching. Also a bit conservative in Indiana and Indiana has always loved the Clintons and Clintons have lots of friends in Indiana. After all she won against Obama in 2008 when people were saying the same then about Obama taking Indiana. Don't get me wrong, lots of Bernie supporters in Indiana, my young relatives some of them :). I probably shouldn't have said this because now I will jinx her and Indiana :), always my luck so I best be quiet!!
2016-04-06	Shelley McCracken Paul Rania I agree Indiana is smart and well educated, that is why Hillary will not win there. People there will actually look at her records, of war mongering, wall street sell out and job exporting, and will drop her like a hot potato.

2016-04-06	No, the fact is that the so called big win is only going to get him a dozen or so delegates. They say 10 in the article, but I think it is closer to 12. The problem is that he is still down by well over 200 delegates. Even after Wyoming he will be down +200 delegates.      He had a nice little run, but it was expected. After Wyoming, it is back to the east coast. Far more minorities (especially AA's), they are primaries, not caucuses, and they are closed.
2016-04-06	Mark Hendricks and yet he's still out raising her, without any corporate support. Money is power in politics, and the passion for Bernie is real. If he loses the primary, he should take his fundraising abilities and use it to add firepower to every progressive candidate running. Then in eight years get another Bernie endorsed progressive on the ballot, and I think they'll clean up.      I think Clinton will make a good president, working within the confines of the system as is, but I also think it's embarrassing for her that with all her entrenched support in both the party and the media, Bernie has made her fight this hard, this long.      The desire for change which goes beyond mere window dressing is real, and if Bernie plays his hand well, his revolution could be well underway.
2016-04-06	The hypocrisy of Team Bernie is Hillaryous. For months they said that if the superdelegates chose the nominee this was proof that the entire system was rigged and corrupt. Now their entire plan is to win with superdelegates.      But its even worse that that. Bernie says over and over again how hes against the insiders and the rich who rig the system for their own advantage, yet he has as his top campaign aide a insider's insider and corporate bagman and influence peddler. Think Monsanto lobbyist and Bernie' top stragist and campaign chief Tad Devine paying himself $850,000 a month might be a reason to keep the campaign alive even after its clear that Sanders cant possibly win?.      Btw, thats 35,000 people who each month give this Bernie Bro hypocrite their $27 bucks.      http://docquery.fec.gov/.../C00577130/B_PAYEE_C00577130.html      As Johnnie Rotten said at the last Sex Pistols show in 1977: " Ha, ha, ha.

2016-04-06	"Trump Effect" is a corollary to the law of unintended consequences. It refers to the perverse effects that flow from any idiotic proposal, statement or behavior which kicks "Murphy's Law" into play. A good example would be Trump's proposed U.S/Mexico border wall.

2016-04-06	Donald Trump said that he is prepared to block money transfers that are the only income of poor Mexican families in order to force the Mexican government to pay $20 million for his wall. It wouldn't work - there are too many ways to move money - but the fact that Trump would propose starving children as a policy tool shows a total lack of concern for anyone but himself.      There is no way Donald Trump can be trusted as Commander in Chief and holder of the nuclear launch codes.

2016-04-06	I strongly urge you to reconsider your vote. Ted Cruz is just another politician trying to tell us the sky isn't blue.   He's a slick laywer turned politician, with his wife and mother having ties to big banking. Why take such as risk on another dirty (we already know he's a liar) lawyer-politician hybrid, when we know Trump will, without a doubt, trim the fat and be a whistle blower? It's time to get somebody in office who will call bullshit when they see it. Cruz is accepting money from big banks... I can't trust that! Trump is the only one not taking bribes and is talking a good game, while Cruz has tuned his message completely around since first running, to be more in line with what Trump is saying.   Is Trump crass? Yes. But that in no way impedes him from doing a great job.

2016-04-06	Virgil Rico Virgil - Your Takeadump acts just like a 5 year old spoiled brat, which I assume he was when he was little. Who's one of your patriot brothers? John Ashcroft?

2016-04-06	Do all these people always whine like babies??? Walker is hardly a Brett Favre. Nobody would want him naked in Crocs!
2016-04-06	At times it seems like Trump is trying to lose.
2016-04-06	Well there are plenty of theories going around that Trump was simply a pawn placed by the democracts to ensure victory. I think Trump is just Trump. Says some really stupid things, but also doesn't give a rat's arse what people think about it. I'd rather have that from a policitian, even if I don't agree with him, then what we always get, which is rehearsed, polished answers said only to please the ears of listeners.
2016-04-06	Out of the mouths of babes. LOL walker are you kidding me. at 37 percent attacking walker is like attacking Brett Farve? Just a little bit narcissistic just like the Trumpster
2016-04-06	Is that like Obama with his ... ME ME ME I I I ... in every speech ...
2016-04-06	Bill Stu No you must be refering to Donald Trump Or Ted Cruz A/K/A Mini Trump. Truly they are the only two narcissists running to be the Republican candidate for President. Walker wanted to be Prersident that would have made three but he made to much a fool out of himself.
2016-04-06	Scooter, you are not Brett Favre. Chester, maybe.
2016-04-06	"Trump Effect" is a corollary to the law of unintended consequences. It refers to the perverse effects that flow from any idiotic proposal, statement or behavior which kicks "Murphy's Law" into play. A good example would be Trump's proposed U.S/Mexico border wall. The cost quickly escalated from 4 billion to 20 billion increasing the deficit and causing U.S. ladder companies to flock to Mexico.
2016-04-06	But in the alternate reality on Planet Trump, it doesn't matter, since Mexico will pay for the wall! And his Duck Dynasty supporters cheer!
2016-04-06	"The cost quickly escalated from 5 billion to 20 billion"   Where did you read that ?
2016-04-06	Rickey Stafford II they didn't include the cost of the gold plated TRUMP logos that will be installed on the wall every 5 miles (on both sides of the wall)

2016-04-06	Hillary Clinton's going to be very upset that Trump will not be getting the nomination.
2016-04-06	Why?? She would beat Cruz just as easily.. only Kasich has a chance and its only because people don't know well enough the evil that lies within him too, though he tries to play the "good ol' farm boy" attitude.. but look at bills he has signed...
2016-04-06	Anne Zobrist is quite right about the Kasich record which, when rvealed, will sink his ship.

2016-04-06	"George W. Bush says he does not like Ted Cruz"      http://www.cnn.com/.../ted-cruz-george-w-bush-jeb-2016/
2016-04-06	Ramon F. Herrera I'm sure he likes Trump even less after the comments Trump has made to Jeb about his brother during the debates.
2016-04-06	Ramon F. Herrera But everyone in the political establishment is scared to death of what a Trump Presidency would be like. At best it would be a four-year stalemate between the President and Congress, at worst Trump would cause irrevocable harm. Cruz is ultra conservative, but he's conventional and, at least in my estimation, has less of a chance of getting elected President than Trump.
2016-04-06	Isn't he running as a Democrat? Just asking. He might be a great Independent (which is what I thought he's been), so now he's upset with the Democratic Party. There are choices, Mr. Sanders.
2016-04-06	Bernie Sanders is running one pf the most negative campaigns I have seen sionce the 80"s!

2016-04-06	If you want to look at negative campaigning, go no further than HRC herself. In this election she's enlisted the services of sleazeball David Brock, whose claim to fame is having smeared Anita Hill so Clarence Thomas could get a life-time SCOTUS apointment. DailyKOS had this to say about her main sleaze-ball advisor:      "David Brock is one of those sleazy practitioners. Brock cut his teeth as a right wing attack dog, smearing Anita Hill for daring to offer negative testimony about Clarence Thomas during Thomas’ Senate confirmation hearing. ...      The one consistent thing about Brock, from his college years through the present day, is his reputation for being a liar and a slimeball.      And, yet, this is the guy Hillary Clinton and her campaign have chosen to be their “go-to” attack dog." (See http://www.dailykos.com/.../-David-Brock-is-the-symptom...)      And then there were the HRC and surrogate's disgusting racially charged attacks on Obama in 2008. Hillary is the QUEEN of sleaze.
2016-04-06	When asked if Sanders will help down ballot democrats, Sanders said "Well, we'll see".   Sanders has an awesome fundraising machine. How much has he contributed to democrats?   Sanders only "became" a democrat a few months ago and admitted that it was for the exposure.      Now he is mad because he feels the DNC has their thumb on the scale? (They do, but being mad about it seems stupid considering the above).
2016-04-06	And how will he ever get any of the snake oil he's selling through Congress unless down ballot Reps get elected? It's what he's all about. All blow with no plans.
2016-04-06	If you haven't noticed, Bernie is in the middle of running a primary. The minute he starts giving my money to corporate Democrats is the moment I stop donating to the Sanders campaign.      Now is not the time to be asking these questions. After the primary is over Sanders can decide who he'd like to support. Frankly, I'd rather him save this money for 2018 so we can use it to oust the corporate lackeys like Claire McCaskill.
2016-04-06	Jason Ward - Pretty sure Hillary is in the same race. She raised over $15M for down ballot dems in the 1st quarter of this year. But you statement is the issue of why he will never get anything passed. How do you expect to get ANYTHING through congress when you don't support down ballot candidates.      That right there is a nutshell of what is wrong with the Sanders campaign. They are just milking you for money because even THEY know they can't legislate a far left agenda from the executive office.      President Sanders to the dems in congress. "I know this is going to be tough on many of you in your districts and states, but I'm really going to need you to go out on a limb and support this proposal".      dems in congress to Sanders. "With all due respect, F*** you,....... sir...."
2016-04-06	Sanders doesn't want to be a democrat. He just wants to use them.

2016-04-06	Alva Edison Well get the hell out of the party. Classic (want something for free) It does not exist.
2016-04-06	Alva Edison - because the DNC supports the only democratic in this race and that's not Bernie. After all, it's not called the DEMOCRATIC National Committee for nothing. It's not called the DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST National Committee. BTW, that's a name Bernie made up out of thin air. There is no such party.
2016-04-06	So he wants the Democratic Nomination even though he hates Democrats?! This guy is one fringy FLAKE!
2016-04-06	You're just plain ignorant. Sanders has caucused with the Democrats in Congress since he was first elected to the House in the 90s. He has a better voing record on Democratic issues that many of Hillary's 'blue dog' and 'New' Democrat supporters.
2016-04-06	Jim Albers Sanders caucuses with the Democrats so he won't forever be a powerless back bencher.
2016-04-06	Jim Albers Bernie's and Hillary's records are about the same . There is no huge differences between the two.
2016-04-06	This will not help you Mr.Sanders in flipping those Super Delegates you want and need so badly.
2016-04-06	which will not help this lieing corporate shill getting elected as President. She is worse than TRUMP
2016-04-06	Yes, why would members of the Democratic National Committee (super delegates) support Sanders from this statement - his statement that he'd think about raising money for the Democratic Party - and constantly dissing the Democratic Party - which he depends upon to voice his message - otherwise his message would be NO WHERE.
2016-04-06	Karl Class Bu buy Bernicia!
2016-04-06	This is great news, now take this fight to the other tax dodgers in corporate America. I can't wait for the rest of the Panama Papers to extend to the America's. Should shake things up pretty well.

2016-04-06	Roy Ellis Federal Income Tax is not the only kind of tax people pay, Roy. Who do you think pays a higher percentage of their income in OVERALL taxes...Donald Trump or the person bagging your groceries?
2016-04-06	Tim Bowlin the OTHER two federal taxes are for insurance policies....and like I said, 43% pay NOTHING to run the country, Timmie
2016-04-06	and yet we still wonder and complain about the high cost of US mediicne but refuse to let them lower their poerating cost which would have made pills cheaper
2016-04-06	Lowering their operating cost will not lower the prices becuase the same drugs theses compaines produce are sold alot cheaper in Canada.
2016-04-06	Lol. Nothing is going to prompt them to lower their prices, even if costs went to zero.
2016-04-06	Ya, they are barely making ends meet. It's ok, single mothers and other hard working Americans are there to help poor old big pharmaceutical. It's the least we can do for all the affordable drugs they make for us

2016-04-06	I guess that was the big surprise the Trump was predicting.
2016-04-06	Losing by 13 pts and losing in the delegate count 6 to 1 is not a "win". It is a butt kicking and Trump's campaign staff know this is #4 in a row. Trump's last win was Arizona. Since then he has picked up a total of 7 delegates. In contrast, Cruz has picked up 96. Looking at the most recent polls out of NY, the race has changed. Cruz has moved past Kasich. In PA, Maryland, and California, Trump's double digit leads have vanished and Cruz is within striking distance. The other reality the Trump supporters and media keep ignoring is in EVERY contest so far, Cruz has outperformed the polls and Trump underperformed. Last night was another example of this truth. Cruz for 8% more than polls showed and Trump got 3% less. Taking that into account, Cruz wins, Pa, Maryland and most of California. The one last truth is GOP voters are realizing not only is Trump a lunatic, he is not a conservative
2016-04-06	He led in the polls a couple of weeks ago and they got their butts handed to them last night.
2016-04-06	Do Trump people ever stop lying? Trump was up in the polls all along except for the last 2 weeks. BTW- we need more cheap shots taken by Trump people against the supporters of other candidates, women and/or minorities- you're getting lazy.

2016-04-06	Want to see what happens when a western government outlaws abortion and makes the woman who obtains an abortion a criminal, look no further than Catholic dominated Northern Ireland. BBC News reports, yesterday, that a woman in Northern Ireland who purchased (online) a drug that was to be used for an abortion was convicted in a CRIMINAL court and given a suspended sentence.
2016-04-06	She's lucky. In the Wholly Babble, she would be stoned to death. Some groups always need a scapegoat. Women's health is not important to old white men.
2016-04-06	Wayne Maynard No, no, no Wayne. In the Bible, had she been suspected of adultery, her husband could have taken her to a priest who would force her to drink an abortion-inducing poison. If the fetus lived through that I guess she was proclaimed innocent. (Numbers 5:19-24)      Poisoned, but innocent. You're right about the women's health not being important to old white males. I don't really think of them as "men". Just little boys with too much power and time on their dirty little hands.

Once they reach the convention he will be discarded like a cig butt. He is being played. Really think Graham, Mittens, Bush, etc like him??

2016-04-06	So if you're not a trumper we should expect you to vote against him if he's the grand old pervert candidate right? If you aren't a trumper yet still vote for the jackass then you are a trumper.      Sadly you think an article that doesn't fit your needs is silly. Wait for it...insert your cries of persecution and victimization by the left wing conspiring mainstream media.
2016-04-06	Juan Valdez at your little college of hard knocks, I am guessing reading and comprehension was not your strong suit and I'll throw in critical thinking on a side note.      Please tell me your not as stupid as you appear. Do you really think in your little shallow world Trump decides what roads get shut down. Do you realize it is secret service that plans the route and shuts down the roads..not Trump, not obama not hillz...you are an abject putz.   I never claim victimization, that is you and your ilk's claim to fame, grow up son and stay in your lane..   I realize now how you got out of the 3rd grade, your family had to burn the school down...next Jaunie.
2016-04-06	I think the point is about the closure of a needed domestic violence center. Not about Trump. But he does somehow make everything about him... I, me, mine. All the time.
2016-04-06	Knock it off. You chose to close. The Secret Service nor any other authority came around and told them they had to close. The moral outrage should be directed toward the center for letting a little bit of traffic stop them from providing their much needed service. So sad that the would try to politicize something so shamelessly.
2016-04-06	You make it sound like they wrote the article...
2016-04-06	I guess you don't pay attention to his entourage and security crap. It isn't a little bit of traffic. Thanks for the exaggeration, though. Sounds oddly familiar. Btw... They're complaining, not politicizing. Shamelessly? Someone has their moral outrage on.
2016-04-06	Almost every time President Obama comes to Los Angeles he stays (or at least has an event) within a few blocks of my home. The traffic jam it causes is ludicrous (we lovingly call it the "Obamajam")      But, I haven't once seen a single business close it doors, even temporarily, due to the President's motorcade (which absolutely dwarfs Trump's entourage).      So, the whole article read like another attempt to blame something in Trump (I'm sure someone will report that Trump is okay with domestic violence because of this article).
2016-04-06	Alright men, line up to beat your wives for tomorrow!! This is seriously a stupid article. Unless they serve dozens a day, if someone is in an emergency 911 services are available.

2016-04-06	The lack of affordable housing is a symptom of a larger problem: income and wealth inequality. Gentrification is what is driving housing prices up. As the earners on top look for their sixteenth and seventeeth homes, affordable tenements are bulldozed to make room for luxurious high-rises which are bought by Russian oligarchs, Chinese billionaires, and Wall Street cocaine-addicts.      Guess what? Property is wealth. Guess what? The top 1% own as much wealth as the bottom 90%. Guess what? That's why housing is unaffordable. Guess what? Nobody addresses this inequality more than Sen. Sanders.      All that said, I agree that he needs a policy specifically to address affordable housing in major urban areas. It's a problem that can't wait for the redistributive effects of his agenda to kick in and, in a lot of cases, housing policy is a major source of institutionalized racism.
2016-04-06	if you desire more "wealth".....go earn it
2016-04-06	Do not be distracted by the corporate media's attempt to throw the kitchen sink at Bernie Sanders before April 19th!   This is your invite!   New York Democratic debate April 14th in Brooklyn. Bernie was born and raised in Brooklyn. Welcome home Bernie!
2016-04-06	Roy Ellis Plenty of people earn their wealth and have it stolen by their corporate wage-slavers. Worker productivity soars, yet wages fall. It's theft, but corporations get away with it because they own and operate every level of government. It's time for workers to benefit from the fruits of their labor, not just shareholders. If people were actually paid what their labor is worth, unemployment would be virtually nonexistent.

The GOP slime machine has dumped millions into our state already to prop up Ayotte and the contest is still very close, even though Hassan hasn't even started really campaigning yet. Ayotte has to answer for being weak on public gun safety, for eagerly signing up to be the third stooge in the doomed attempt to keep the Benghazi non-scandal alive, and now for deciding to ignore her constitutional responsibility to advise and consent on a Supreme Court nomination. She has no accomplishments in the Senate other than being a reliable GOP party cog. We need better.

2016-04-06	Everyone I know in California is a Sanders supporter. How are the polls you're looking at being conducted? I know the ones that I have seen for New York were conducted by calling landlines, which are overwhelmingly limited to the older generations, and thus would be skewed towards HRC.

2016-04-06	What working people need to hear from Bernie is how he intends to do any of the things he says he will do. I don't think any democrats have a problem with what Bernie wants....it's just that most of us know that what he wants can't be done .... of course, Bernie has no idea how they're to be done also....something that the NY media will be pressing him on. Clinton has solutions that can be accomplished and will be steps toward what, as democrats, we all want.
2016-04-06	YOU ALL FORGET MANY OTHER FACTORS:   ex: any EDUCATED Delegates know Shillary is TOXIC (and hated by ALL parties) (as 2008 proved irrefutably: her OWN party rejected her for the unknown and "unelectable" novice).... it's clear SHE IS THE GOP'S ONLY HOPE TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. ANY other Democrat would literally have been a wiser choice.      Her scandals are worse than any other candidate in HISTORY! From DOMA to war crimes to her admitted crimes in Servergate (and NO, I'm not talking about classified emails so don't mention that red herring)... she's A DISASTER.      Hell, TRUMP could defeat her with literally 2 words:      "IRAQ WAR".      You're going to see the DNC ESTABLISHMENT realize Shillary sinks the more voters hear her phoniness.
2016-04-06	Okay Andy, tell us what these admitted crimes in 'servergate' are. You distort what happened in 2008. Obama was and unknown, but, we (his supporters) all knew he was electable....and it was the super-d's who put him over the top. You honestly think that the DNC establishment is going to suddenly realize anything new about Hillary after the many years she's been working and fighting for them? No, they will stick with her, and rightfully so. Barack Obama was a better candidate than Hillary and deserved his two terms in office. Bernie Sanders is NO Barack Obama!
2016-04-06	You are right -- Hillary has incredibly huge, wide-spread and historic baggage going back 30 years, and any GOP candidate would destroy her. She can't win the general election.
2016-04-06	Susan Burke youre right - hes better.
2016-04-06	I stopped reding after this statement "Even if Sanders does surpass Clinton in New York and subsequent states, it’s still very unlikely he can accrue enough delegates to overtake Clinton – let alone win a majority among the pledged delegates to counter Clinton’s current edge with unpledged superdelegates."
2016-04-06	That is what is most important...and true.
2016-04-06	Susan Burke vote for her he wins it really is that simple.

2016-04-06	I like Bernie, but he needs to stay on message and give more vision like he said he would. When you do the things your opponent does their no difference in you and the person you're blasting. Suggestion: Stay with the politics and not compare with the military. We have the greatest fighting force in the world, but we have the same problems in the military that they have in politics, dishonest leaders who do things for their personal, and sometimes attacking others for gain when it’s not needed. Military doesn’t want to say it out loud, but’s it’s real. Voting for the candidate with a clear vision, and will take of our vets.
2016-04-06	He is a jerk.
2016-04-06	when you have nothing to say to a logical and rational statement, spout inane and accusatory comments like "he is a jerk" just to justify your viewpoints. nice
2016-04-06	Rosalie Fontaine Perhaps when there is a logical and rational rational statement.
2016-04-06	Rosalie Fontaine He's either going to lose the Dem nomination or the general election. My preference would be the nomination - so the Dem Party doesn't have ot gamble on the electability (or not) of an openly socialist candidate. There's too much at stake, for years (Supreme Court; environmental, civil, labor, and voting rights, etc.) to throw it away. Repubs HOPE we'll choose Bernie; they'll trounce him as a far-out wacko.
2016-04-06	This NY primary is going to be awesome! Give 'em hell Bernie! The national mainstream media will continue to campaign for Hillary, but the competitive NY tabloid press will go after both sides, as they already have. I can't wait!
2016-04-06	I agree, but for different reasons than you.
2016-04-06	In a closed primary? in a large, racially diverse major city? Maybe I am wrong but that has not been a good combination for him so far
2016-04-06	Mark Keeler you are right the ethnic vote is low information. They vote for what's easier.
2016-04-06	Supposed Democrat Bernie Sanders should apologize to America for supporting Ralph Nader in the 2000 election and hence allowing the election of George W. Bush.
2016-04-06	Uh, did he actually support Nader in 2000?
2016-04-06	Drew Wenger third paragraph: http://theweek.com/.../bernie-sanders-2016-lot-common...   Funny thing, facts, and the archive of the Internet.
2016-04-06	Tony Gamino - You're exactly right, Tony. Among other things this clown Bernie ought to apologize for getting Dubya elected by supporting Nader. Most of all, however, he owes Hillary a MAJOR apology for lying and saying she said he was unqualified to be President. The irony is, of course, that Sanders IS deeply unfit to be President and never will be.
2016-04-06	What! What does a parent asking for an apology from Bernie, does he then say Hillary should apologize to our men and women of the Iraq war, and the trade agreements of her husbands presidency. This thing is getting one sided. The final decision for the war was Bush and Cheney and Hillary did support her husband. What else would she have done. Obama picked Hillary as his secretary of state and Biden as his vice president (who voted for the Iraq was also). Enough said
2016-04-06	How about all the parents in Iraq who lost children due to the Iraq war? Sounds like HRC should apologize for that.

2016-04-06	This rally was in Nassau County.
2016-04-06	Richard Burns Don't baffle the clueless and IQ-less with facts. It only upsets them and they have to crawl back into their safe space.
2016-04-06	Donald Trump's opponents have their party yesterday after the Wisconsin primary, but that will stop in New York when he does very well in the state. Expect them to see them crying more than celebrating from April 19 to the end of this month when the Northeastern primaries start a week after New York's. Ted Cruz is going to get his Texan buttocks kicked twice this month, the second time much more deeper than the first.
2016-04-06	Ironic you say that given that Trump will do worse in NY in the general election than either Texas or Wisconsin.
2016-04-06	"the second time much more deeper than the first?" What??
2016-04-06	Who cares... the guy is in his home state in a republican primary... he'll act like this is the biggest win of the primary season. Of course he's going to win his home state, just like cruz smacked trump down in texas and kasich won Ohio. The guy will still end up the biggest general election loser since mondale.
2016-04-06	Why not Cruz people acted like him winning Texas was the greatest thing possible.
2016-04-06	Heck Trump is *from* NY. Maybe he will *finally* get over 50% of the vote in a Primary.
2016-04-06	Its not Trump vs. Cruz...its Trump vs. Cruz+media+Establishment+Special Interest+SuperPacs NeverTrump groups. New Yorkers are used to media hype and will hopefully keep focused and remember Cruz should be punished for his NY Values comments...as Cruz thinks he's too good for NY people.
2016-04-06	Trump doesn't explemify NY values outside (arguably) Staten Island, Putnam County and rural counties.
2016-04-06	I'm not a Cruz fan, but the point of the comment was NY people think they're better than everybody else.. Of course you missed that, cause you're probably one of them..      Btw, this is coming from a person whose mother and 3 oldest siblings NGOs are from Queens..
2016-04-06	Richard Burns "NY values"...meaning cocaine and opiates.
2016-04-06	It is fantastic the manure you're having to wade through Donald Trump! I would be ashamed to be an American Veteran if it were not for people like you Mr. Trump! It seems incredulous that so many ugly aliens that have no right to be here are outdoing themselves to smear you along with the republican establishment who spends freely to try and sway the   weak minded to not vote for you...

2016-04-06	The VOTERS will decide who is qualified, and Sanders may not like the answer.
2016-04-06	That is true, but the voters can be misguided as they often were in the past.
2016-04-06	Agreed. And there might just be some surprises for Clinton in November. It will be very difficult for her without progressives and Independents.
2016-04-06	Well they did vote for Bush twice, so there's hope for Hill.
2016-04-06	Why is Bernie running for President? Sound more like he thinks he qualified to be god? Minnie Trump is getting laughable now.
2016-04-06	We need to get out on April 19th in droves and get rid of this guy now. He has become a hazzard to our party but more importantly to the coutnry. He is at Trump level now and he needs to go.
2016-04-06	Jane Mark I have heard of a group of folks who ultimately want HRC but they like it that Bernie has pushed her. If that is true perhaps they should stop. I am starting to believe that electing Bernie would be as dangerous as electing Trump. And that is scary.
2016-04-06	Where did you get that "he thinks he is qualified to be god"??
2016-04-06	Do any of those criticisms apply to President Obama as well? If so, hasn't Sanders just said Obama is unqualified to be president?
2016-04-06	Obama didn't vote for the Iraq war.
2016-04-06	Bryan Morris That one, I knew the answer was "no" to. But what about the others?
2016-04-06	I think The President now has to come out and support Hillary. He was her Secretary of state and he seved in the senate with her. He certianly knows she is qulified to be president and he needs to say so. Bernie has hated the President and hsi party for 25 years not. I would have voted for him if he had won the nominee in order to keep the GOP out of the white house. Now he could not buy my vote. I hope even more super delegates will come out tonight and tell this worm to get lost.
2016-04-06	Felons aren't qualified to be President. The indictment for destruction of Government Documents is coming.
2016-04-06	you poor thing.

2016-04-06	I hope that Giuliani can see what aliar that Pinochio Ted Cruz is.
2016-04-06	I suspect he has seen what a liar Trump is, and is concerned.
2016-04-06	Gene Church      He's known Trump for 30 years or more. I suspect they know each other very well.      Besides, it's not as if Rudy hasn't told a few whoppers of his own (cough, Bernard Kerik, cough.)
2016-04-06	Gene Baily Ted Cruz is NOT a liar! He did not lie in how you are being told that he did. You are not looking at it for yourself.
2016-04-06	Couple mpnths ago Guilioni said he took calls from several candidates & would give advice to any who asked for it so this is meh..
2016-04-06	It looks as though Cruz is trying to come to an accommodation with the Establishment. There is a deal to be cut. Before the end of June Cruz will cut the deal with Rubio for his 170 delegates. Then he will finish the deal with the Establishment. John Kasich has no chance of getting the nomination. Somebody has to pay for is campaign to continue. Without money Kasich would have been long gone. So the Establishment is keeping Kasich in the race for one purpose, to deny Trump the delegates to wrap up the nomination before the convention. In exchange for his support and delegates Kasich will be na...See More

2016-04-06	"For his delegates Rubio will probably be offered either Chief of Staff in a Cruz Administration or Secretary of State. Rubio is the policy wonk and is considered to be well versed on foreign affairs. Also Rubio is the bridge between the Tea Party / True Conservatives and the Establishment. This will position Rubio to work with all sides of the Republican dived to pass a Cruz agenda through Congress; the opposite of the Obama Administration who governed by Fiat. This is the deal Bill O'Riley reported is in the works on the Factor tonight."      If I remember correctly, Rubio was going to become a private citizen after his senate term.      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXltF2AXTI
2016-04-06	And you forget one simple scenario Donald Trump You realy think Trump will take his toys and go home ? You realy think Cruz will make Kasich VP and Rubio will take janitor position in Cruz ''administration '' lol . GOP cheating Trump will never win in 2016 and will be finish . You can call Trump enything you like expect one You can't call Him foolish .Stop watching "West wing"

2016-04-07	I agree. Obama is a damned idiot.
2016-04-07	Rick Roe Sr. Yes I agree with you Donald Trump is a damned idiot.
2016-04-07	Rick Roe Sr. Trump is overwhemingly looked at as a circus show around the planet. The president is overwhemingly looked at as one of the best Presidents America has had in a long time. That clearly states who is and who is not half baked.

2016-04-07	It is not Donald Trump that should make the media question their souls. They have been soulless long before that point. Stephanopolis, for example, and his unabashed bias towards Hillary Clinton, Andrea Mitchell's manipulative editing, and then that whole thing with Trayvon Martin and the edited 911 call.      The media is supposed to be impartial. But it's clear they have an agenda.

2016-04-07	The reality is that the Press has also been involved in creating Donald Trump along with the GOP. They need to look at themselves and ask the question are they journalists seeking news or are they just seeking entertainment to make more money and to make their talking points. Ubfortunately they refuse to accept that they are part of the problem

"Don't destroy the Democratic Party to satisfy the secretary's ambitions to become president of the United States," Weaver told CNN. "Let's not denigrate each other's supporters and tear the party apart." "The senator has tried to run an issue-oriented campaign; obviously the contrast has become sharper of late," he added.

Scary to see that it's all linked to the same owners and the fact that these owners are also in the top10 of donors to Clinton.
2016-04-07	What??? Bernie Sanders is pushing Israel toward Obama. This is priceless. President Obama has already locked Hillary Clinton down to his hip. And, he just might be able to force the Republican party into a breakup. He already showed that Russia's power will not extend beyond Ukraine. President Obama is a master at statecraft.
2016-04-07	Hugh Johnson When? He's only said that about Clinton.
2016-04-07	So now the fracturing of the GOP (brought on by years of carefully cultivated anger provided by Limbaugh, Hannity and their ilk, and fostered by McTurtle and the 'try for eight years to make Obama a four-year president' club) is "Obama forcing the Republican party into a breakup"?

2016-04-07	Yeah, Maryland is going to be a big win for Clinton. Close to 20 points.      New Jersey and DC are also going to be big wins for Clinton.      That is why the path is so hard for Sanders. When you take into account those states, it means Sanders needs to win eveyything else by high margins. Getting a tie in NY and PA won't help him.
2016-04-07	This is how the FBI destroys Hillary: The 10 questions that could end her White House dreams   These questions, if answered honestly, would most likely hand the Democratic nomination to Bernie Sanders      http://www.salon.com/.../this_is_how_the_fbi_destroys.../
2016-04-07	Obama will not let it happen. She will get a pradon
2016-04-07	Duke Jordan Uhm....a "pradon" won't do her any good Duke.....
2016-04-07	Wah, wah, wah, if the GOP hasnt "destroyed" Hillary yet, they wont. Gowdy retires and so should you. This is getting old. Hey, remember that time that fool GOPer clearly stated this farce of an investigation was part of a plan to destroy Hills campaign and not because of actual wrong doing? That was funny, and typical. We will have our first woman president and you will have an orange loser and a punchable faced weirdo that nobody can stand. Enjoy!...
2016-04-07	LOL another example of the Mini Trumpster cheating the law. He learned very well from the old man Donald Trump.
2016-04-07	Trump doesn't accept money from PAC's. Obviously Cruz did not learn to deal with or subvert the law by getting companies to donate above their legal limit from him. I like how you somehow twisted this into being about Trump when it has nothing to do with him. You should work for Cruz!
2016-04-07	Computer Hero give me a break. Trump plays a little known game called bait and switch. You see he loans his campaign money and then he solicits money for his campaign so he can pay back all the money he has loaned himself. Only rich people can do this. Who needs a PAC. It is slimy and discusting. So what Ted A/K/A Mini Trump does he learned from the Donald. And if you have not figured it out by now I could care less about Ted Cruz Mini Trump and could care less about Donald Trump. They are both two peas from the same pod. Get over it.
2016-04-07	Computer Hero Trump's super pac accepts money.
2016-04-07	Rafael (Carnival) Cruz = Trump Lite
2016-04-07	Super-PACs MUST be banned! They give a few wealthy exploiters the ability to shape our entire political system; they allow for absurdly unequal representation! The people and corporations funding these PACs have acquired their wealth from selling out America through political favors, endless wars, unfair trade deals, exploiting foreign labor, exploiting illegal labor within our borders, creating insurmountable debt for our children, and maintaining a rigged election process that ensures nothing will change. Super-PACs are a direct conflict of interest and an absolute corrupting force!      In my o...See More
2016-04-07	Rafael Castro Cruz love those Cuban values
2016-04-07	Trump may exaggerate, but he doesn’t lie – Cruz is a pathological liar! Try these for starters. (All Trump’s positions discussed have been cast in stone since day one and everyone, including Cruz, knew them.) https://youtu.be/zwIHJhtTSLg and then https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMvuuywiQcw and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7gZ3_I7lW4
2016-04-07	Book 'em. Enforce the law.
2016-04-07	There's a reason they call him Lyin' Ted. He holds the Bible up, and then he puts it down. And then he lies, cheats, and will steal to fulfill his childhood dream of ruling the world. I'm done voting for corrupt lawyers
2016-04-07	Lying Ted, holds up his bible and lies. Eddie Guerrero should be proud that Ted Cruz: He lies, he steals, he cheats.
2016-04-07	Lying Ted is now Begging cheating lying Ted.
2016-04-07	That is flailing....
2016-04-07	In reality, this is nothing compared to what is going on in the GOP. Already Clinton is saying that she would take Bernie over Trump and Cruz any day. This in all reality is a little red meat that the press is trying to project to make money.
2016-04-07	Roland Sorenson - He can want all of it....and that is fine. But the honesty comes to an end it terms of actually getting it done. How does he plan on doing it? Do you think he can get something through a republican led and gerrymandered house? Think he can get a GOP senate to go along? Think he can even get dems to support him (you know, the same ones he isn't sure if he would support)?
2016-04-07	Neal Levine BS, is worse. Dems areSplit, the GOP will vote for anyone other than the Commie or Hillary. Sanders and HIllary are polar opposites, not even in the same ballpark type of candidates.
2016-04-07	someone needs a nap.
2016-04-07	I know!! Those rings under Hillary eyes are bad!
2016-04-07	Maureen Driscoll Whitney looks like someone needs glasses and a reality check. Bernie is cooked.
2016-04-07	Maybe he will finally comb his hair when he wakes up
2016-04-07	Funny how Bernie blasts the media but then uses their words to hit Hillary rather than use the words she really said.      Kinda hypocritical to both rail against the media, and then to use them to attack your opponent. Pick a lane, Bernie.
2016-04-07	You know what's hypocritcal? Taking money from the gun lobby then accusing your opponent of favoring the NRA over children. Or how about taking millions of dollars from Wall Street and insisting you'll be toughest on reigning in the big banks. Or maybe taking several million dollars from the fossil fuel industry then promoting you're an advocate for the fight against climate change. The list goes on and on. Rant about Bernie all you want, but one of the last things he can be labled with is being a hypocrit.
2016-04-07	Oh come on, the Clinton campaign strategy that came out was "Disqualify Him, Defeat Him, Unify the party after".
2016-04-07	Clinton typically uses surrogates for the purposes of plausible deniability. If she didn't mean that, she'd tell David Brock et. al to "cut it out."
2016-04-07	He needs to shutup! If he doesn't want to be gossiped about. He is the one talking in front of the media. Their job is to spin and report.
2016-04-07	These media outlets are owned by corps that are among HRC's biggest investors. You think its spin and report? Last month Kasich had more press and media time than Bernie; 25x the amount in fact. A guy that has won one state total in his own primary and struggles to break 15% in most states had 25x the amount of coverage.      That's not spin and report, its a hatchet job.
2016-04-07	He wasn't "gossiped about." He's referencing credible sources that have headlined him as "unqualified" and how they are going to "disqualify" him. He was reactive rather than proactive. If you want to victimize the aggressor, then that's on you.      http://www.cnn.com/.../hillary-clinton-bernie.../index.html
2016-04-07	Yeah. HAHAHAHA He is NOT making it any better for himself.      It coudn't be happening to a better snarling rat dog.
2016-04-07	Jeff Weaver Sander's Campaign Manager" Clinton made a deal with the devil...." on MSNBC Steve Kornacki.... and if she takes $$$ from large Companies...they expect a return...its ok for Bernie to question Clinton motives, dare you question his.......
2016-04-07	Gianpaolo Brasca, I saw that. Jeff Weaver whined that Hillary was smearing Bernie with innuendo and then ENGAGED IN INNUENDO about Hillary and Wall Street. Hillary is going to come back with the argument that by Bernie's standards, Obama and Kerry weren't qualified either.
2016-04-07	Cheryl Onstad By Bernie's calculations, if you do not agree with him 100%, if you do not march in lock-step with Bernie Sanders, you are somehow unqualified to be president. He's wrong, and this vanity campaign he's running is bad for Democrats. It is time for him to act like a Democrat and commit to helping down ballot Dems and thinking of more than his own ambitions.
2016-04-07	You mean like Bernie's motives to help the working and middle class? His motive to avoid war? His motive to extend health care to all Americans? His motive for people who work full time to not be in poverty? For college to be affordable? His motive to address climate change? Which motive of Bernie's is not good for the 99%? Can you name one?
2016-04-07	Hillary takes the high road whiile Bernie rolls around in the gutter.
2016-04-07	Her key qualification is to act in the sense of knowing exactly how things play. Unfortunatly familiarity breeds contempt and the longer she is exposed to her record she has more difficulty ignoring Bernie, reality, and her abilities to change course for the better.
2016-04-07	William Wilson This is nothing compared to what is going on in the GOP. I mean the Republicans literally hate both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz that they can taste it. Hillary just stated she would take Bernie over Trump or Cruz any day. This is just red meat to give the press fodder to make money.
2016-04-07	And why did Bernie Sanders say that about her? Because she implied that he was unfit to be president.Karma is hell.
2016-04-07	Hillary Clinton is a far classier person and candidate than that grumpy old man.
2016-04-07	Very classless position we see from more of the Hillary crowd.
2016-04-07	William Wilson Oh, the irony!
2016-04-07	Hugh Johnson Yet Bernie has been right on almost all key issues while Hillar was wrong and reckless. Facts and history are a strange thing in that you can't rewrite them later as Hillary tries.
2016-04-07	Spoken like a democrat. At least one is running.
2016-04-07	"Don't make promises you don't keep, know what you want to achieve, and then bring everybody together to get the results,"      That is a very interesting shot at Sanders, but I have to agree. My #1 issue with Sanders is that there is no way he can deliver.   Obama tried free community college.   Obama tried single payer healhcare.   Hell, Obama nominated a moderate SC justice and the GOP won't even have a hearing.      How is Sanders going to get any of this plan through? Especially if he is wishy-washy on supporting down ballot democrats?      As far as Bernie over Cruz or Trump? Yes please.
2016-04-07	I guess the republicans who you all claim have been after Hillary Clinton for years (there's even a book) are going to roll out the red carpet for her. Your ignorance is appalling
2016-04-07	Obama never tried single payer health care.   Corporate Clintons gutted welfare, pushed prisons, and sent jobs off shore. Deliveables to be proud of. Youwant more of the same?
2016-04-07	Nelson Frederick - No, of course they won't roll out the red carpet. But it will be easier to get the few remaining moderates on board along with ALL of the dems because HRC's agenda isn't nearly as far left and Bernie's is. Plus, Hillary will actually have the support of the dems. Bernie? I'm not so sure about.
2016-04-07	Sanders truly crossed the line. He's been attacking her character and integrity for weeks. He reminds you of the kid that throws rocks, then hides his hands. He gave an awful interview, and when the media and Clinton call him out (he would have been all over it), he clearly is cracking under the pressure. Hillary is justified in highlighting the contrast between them. He also SHOULD be able to clearly answer questions that are asked of him. People aren't WRONG for pressing him on specifics.      GO HILLARY!
2016-04-07	It's call telling the truth about your opponent in a race to secure a nomination, did you forget that? And people are not wrong for calling Hillary out on her lies.
2016-04-07	Nelson Frederick what lies? sanders is the one lying and you're believing the BS..shame.
2016-04-07	“I don’t believe that she is qualified if she is, through her super PAC, taking tens of millions of dollars in special-interest funds,” he said.
2016-04-07	Now that Cruz was able to wound Trump in Wisconsin, Kasich (the only one to lead the polls in the general electon), should be the obviuous choice.
2016-04-07	The Pollster still have Carson in the lead!
2016-04-07	Yep just like he can win Wisconsin. Just like he is surging in the polls in Pennsylvania into 3rd place when there is only three candidates running. Out of all the primaries and caucuses that have been held he has just won one. His home State. What is it about John Kasich that he sees in himself that nobody else sees.
2016-04-07	Neal Levine   I see it. One learns to be comfortable in a minority.
2016-04-07	Establishment trying hard to keep their ego intact wishfully thinking they can bribe delegates for him changing the rules even though he doesn't win eight states with delegates lead.corruption
2016-04-07	George Read think about RNC not respecting voters mandate for trump , Cruz started sneaking Blackfoot deals with I pledged delegates all states Trump one . Now they want to stop trump not to get enough delegates for open convention. Kasich is their agent hoping he will get to be president or he will be successful in stoping trump. RNC corruption . They don't like either trump or Cruz . Cuban priest and trump no establishment. Kasich is their choice even though he fails utterly. There are some irrational heads out there think he is nice guy it he is there to spoil and stop trump.
2016-04-07	Unfathomable. This guy is the best candidate and he gets no traction. American's love their comic book heros. Actual thinking bedamned.
2016-04-07	Best candidate? I personally don't like NAFTA, amnesty, boots on the ground in the Ukraine, and presidents pandering to Black Lives Matter, myself. I can go on...hes's basically Hillary Clinton; but then look who funds him (Soros).
2016-04-07	Daniel Markowski   If you actually believe any of this, there is nothing I can add.
2016-04-07	please explain why he worked at Lehman?
2016-04-07	Kadich has been fooling voters saying he will win since that Ohio win , no evidence or not even close. First of all he is there spoil the broth no way he is winning . He is not doing his job in his state wasting time trying to stop Trump . i have a feeling his ratings go so low in the state of Ohio.
2016-04-07	This man is just crazy. He is lower than Rubio in delegates count yet still claiming to have a path? Some psycho doctors are urgently needed to check him out. He's just plain delusional
2016-04-07	This is bad.....but my first thought was more along the lines of....she didn't fit?
2016-04-07	Thought the same thing.
2016-04-07	George Read Me too.
2016-04-07	Yeah Politico shame on you. That headline essentially says she's too fat.
2016-04-07	She made it work.....go Clinton
2016-04-07	New Yorker's can't get those skinny transit cards to work either. You need to swipe with a rhythm to pass the card through the reader and if you not riding regularly you lose it. Besides everyone knows white people have no rhythm. The MTA is in the process of replacing them.

2016-04-07	wow, really???? you post have nothing to do with the topic, Skylar
2016-04-07	Roy Ellis what are you talking about yes it does wtf did you read the article or??
2016-04-07	I don't know how anyone who doesn't use the subway in NYC would know. I had a problem when I found out i had to have exact change to get on a bus in Philly.
2016-04-07	Exact change? That's not inconvenient at ALL.
2016-04-07	Myron B. Pitts It's not a problem that I encounter anymore, which is good since I don't carry a wallet or a pocket book. Change weighs down my pant pockets.

2016-04-07	Lighter news is a part of news. Nothing new and the same principle applies to political coverage.
2016-04-07	Hell yea Bernie! Give her hell. Time to win this thing. We are behind you and back your every word on Clinton. America loves you!
2016-04-07	What's wrong with the Wealthy? Is this some kind of new bigotry where you cast a whole group of people together and make a judgement?
2016-04-07	Matt Potter What's wrong with plantation owners? They gave those slaves a place to live and food, right?
2016-04-07	Steven Smith We don't have have Slavery, it was made illegal after the Republicans beat up the Democrats in the Civil War. People's income isn't really your business, that's the whole point of living in America, minding your own business. Don't be a Bigot. What did Bill Gates or Elon Musk ever do to you?
2016-04-07	But Sanders does have a Super Pac supporting him...
2016-04-07	It's called donations from Americans
2016-04-07	Ol' Bluegrass - No, Steve is correct. Bernie as a SuperPac supporting him.      http://www.cnn.com/.../bernie-sanders-super-pac-nurses.../
2016-04-07	Ol' Bluegrass Every GOP Superpac is funded by contributions from Americans. The inability to throw an ounce of perspective is rampant among Sanders supporters.
2016-04-07	The Clinton's don't "fundraise". They "shakedown".
2016-04-07	Bill Shailor don't be jealous.
2016-04-07	Bernie Sanders is in full panic mode.
2016-04-07	Winning seven of the last eight states will do that to you.
2016-04-07	Tom Planamento He know he will not win NY or PA or even CA with margins that will gain on Clitnon. . He is losing non white voters by 3 - 1 against Hillary. Winning white states isn't the same as winning big states.
2016-04-07	And he netted a whole 3 delegates in Wisconsin! Wow!!!! At this rate he may have enough delegates in 2024! You go Bernie! :)
2016-04-07	Sanders is sounding more and more like the Republican candidates with his attacks on Hillary Clinton. Not every wealthy person is corrupt. Democrats (including HIllary) don't vote in lockstep with Republicans on behalf of corporations. They vote against each other.      I think Sanders is shooting himself in the foot by becoming more negative and dishonest.      Here's a very good article by the CEO of General Electric:      https://www.washingtonpost.com/.../8499bc8c-fc23-11e5...
2016-04-07	The R's wouldn't really mind Hillary, she's Pro Business and growing the Economy, where Bernie is Anti Business and is all about Shrinking it.
2016-04-07	Matt Potter You are certainly right about one thing. Hillary is Republican-lite. Bernie is not anti business, unless that business is corrupt and screwing the american workers.
2016-04-07	Barb Campbell: Thanks for the link. It is hard to believe Bernie has not visited the GE Aviation plant in Vermont. It employs 1000 people with good paying jobs. GE Healthcare in Vermont also employs another 340 people in Burlington Vermont. GE generates 40 million dollars a year in spending throughout his state and he attacks the company. Wow!
2016-04-07	How come the nose of doctor Carson was black and now it is brown??? (and very smelly!)
2016-04-07	Just wondering at what price did Dr. Carson sell his political soul to Trump?
2016-04-07	NOT 1 Penny Donn, Ben Carson has more integrity than anyone, and only him and TRUMP are the REAL Patriots!
2016-04-07	"it’s kind of ironic that a lot of people who were so critical of him are now jumping on the bandwagon because it suits their needs"      'Their needs' being preventing a bigoted, xenophobic know-nothing with zero interest or perspicacity into any form of economic, domestic or foreign policy from attaining the most powerful elected position in the world.

2016-04-07	Yo Fallon, we think Hillary should stop sucking wallstreet for money because someday she'll have to return the favor. And it's not a false accusation. It's fact. Facts have a liberal bias.
2016-04-07	How is the demonization of Wall Street any different then Trumps demogogic demonization of Muslims and mexicans? Apparently Wall Street manages and builds wealth for retirement savings and charitable foundations, allows for accessible credit, invests in economic growth and provides market stability. Who knew? "Wall Street" gives to both sides because "Wall Street" isn't a thing, it's a large group of people working in the financial industry with different motivations and beliefs.
2016-04-07	Brian Fejer Sorry thank you for correcting me... Yo Fallon, we think Hillary should stop sucking some guys on wallstreet for money because it makes all of wallstreet look bad. People might think that when you receive money from people that make their living by doing investments and playing with other people's money that someday those same people that gave you money will want their investment back and ask for special favors... And ultimatly you will enforce the interrests of the people who gave you a lot of money over the good of those who gave you less. That's Politics... And so mister Fallon, could you look into that please instead of worrying about timeouts and stuff.
2016-04-07	Brian Fejer You forgot about the, "and enriched themselves while bankrupting everyone else's 401k plans and tanked the economy", part.
2016-04-07	They need to take a time out? Sanders is right on the money. If you believe that selling your soul in order to achieve power is acceptable...then vote for Hillary. If you believe that putting your own ambition ahead of people's lives...then vote for Hillary. If you believe that it is perfectly acceptable to leave the US and its secrets open to foreign hacking because you live as if you are above the law...vote for Hillary. NOTHING she has done has been done to benefit the country as a whole...only herself and her sense of entltement to the WH. People talk abou the Republican Party imploding...but Hillary is well on her way to damaging the Democratic Party between risking completely losing any chance of unifying the party and the un-democratic super delegate vote.
2016-04-07	Hugh Johnson That sounds like a perfect example of projection.
2016-04-07	Oh please! Get real. Sanders is taking you all for a ride and taking the last bit of your money on false promises and unicorns. He is a lying old fart who thinks he is the messiah and he is leading his cult to the edge and trying to take America with it.
2016-04-07	If you think someone who has said that he has never run a negative campaign, and then does, is not selling their soul, you are mistaken. He signed on the dotted line when he chose to run as a Democrat as well. But I forgot, your messiah can do no wrong.
2016-04-07	Bernie has started to play very dirty, which is disappointing. I think all of this is related to his weak start in NY, with the Daily News interview. He is embarassed and wants to create diversions. Frankly, I think it will backfire on him because Hillary didn't say he was not qualified, and it is pretty funny to have a guy who has not been a Democrat feigning concern about the future of the Democratic party.
2016-04-07	Sanders has caucused with the Democratic Party for twenty five years, the Daily News story has been debunked and Hillary has been saying that he was unqualified for the office since the very first debate.      If you have any interest in keeping a viable Democratic Party, it would be best for you to realize that insulting the intelligence of half of the Party and Democratic leaning Independents is not a good strategy for maintaining it.
2016-04-07	Why would you think that Bernie is only pretending to be concerned about the Democrat Party? He may have been an Independent, but of the two main parties, he identifies most closely with Democrats.
2016-04-07	Actually Kathy, Hillary did say he was not qualified to be president after the interview AND look at this tweet Hillary sent out just yesterday!!!   She is blaming him for the death of sandy hook children! That is absolutely disgusting politics!!   https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/717797172154998784      Don't be fooled into thinking Bernie is just lashing out randomly at her. He is only responding in kind to the kind of accusations she has made upon his campaign recently.
2016-04-07	Hillary's campaignmanager should seek fault in his own team. DON'T BULLY BERNIE!
2016-04-07	No kidding what fault? They have a 200 pledged delegate lead whereas President Obama only had a 108 delegate lead at this exact time in 2008. Additionally he only had 20 more superdelegates than her wheras now Hillary has 430 more than Bernie. Seems to me like they are stomping ass by any concievable metric, but then again I am fond of using facts and logic and even reading things.
2016-04-07	Jeff Nordley and you feel that those super delegates that she bought before the race even started, some of whom are lobbyists is a good reason to support her?
2016-04-07	Hugh Johnson http://www.desmogblog.com/.../hillary-clinton-john...
2016-04-07	Get used to it. She is going to be the next U.S. Senator from California. I hope that Dildo or whatever his name is gets some jail time for his lying "expose".
2016-04-07	I mean the evidence from his video is pretty clear cut. Wouldnt classify it as "lying". On the other hand its good due process he is being investigated as there is probably enough evidence for a case agaisnt him (And all whisleblowers).      I am really confused that the same people that give praise to Snowden are the first to call for this man's head. Didnt they legally violate the same type of laws that all whistleblowers do?
2016-04-07	Mitchell Moore The label of whistleblower is tpyically given to an employee who outs their employer. Snowden violated the law, should stop being Putin's puppet, and come home and face the music.      The PP video guy violated the law by falsifying government documents. He's not being charged for being a "whistleblower" and he didn't even reveal any illegal activity. He released highly edited videos that did not prove what he claimed to have proved. There have been mutliple investigations into those videos much of which have been lead by Republican officials and every single one has found that PP has violated no laws. However he has now been indicted in two different jurisdictions (TX and CA) for his actions.
2016-04-07	Mitchell Moore No. The difference here is that this Daleiden dude went into this whole thing trying to uncover something that wasn't there. Where Snowden went to work for the contractor not knowing there was going to be abuses and then was given top secret clearance and saw all the abuses and realized that these abuses violated the constitution (like everyone predicted the Patriot Act would do.) So he released the information so people wouldn't be blind about the Patriot Act.      Texas has actually filed charges against him for making fraudulent claims and fraudulent movies. From what I remember he does face jail time, so this is the reason why he was getting his home raided. You get indicted and are going to court, you get your house raided.
2016-04-07	Good luck with that...      When you get indicted for stuff, you tend to get your home raided.
2016-04-07	so explain how an indictment in Houston Texas allows the California States Attorney General to conduct a raid on his property? If the search was requested by the state of Texas, it should be their deputies performing it. If it's a federal case, the feds should be there. But it's a Texas case and a Cali attorney general making the decision on how to move forward. Sorry, you don't get to just decide you have jurisdiction without any charges in your district and then use charges from half the country away to justify your actions.
2016-04-07	Grant Johannessen Not that facts mattter, but he used a fake California driver's license. BTW - did you attend the Trump school of law?
2016-04-07	Grant Johannessen If the search was done without a warrant, whatever was found cannot be used in any case. If there was a search warrant, then there was reason to search.
2016-04-07	I think the better question is why do these anti-choice groups support a man that has been indicted for crimes in Texas and Californai.
2016-04-07	It messes with the narrative. Even in this article the lie about the tapes.
2016-04-07	Amon Amarth I find it sickening that you try and use the crazy person in Colo Springs as a Christian in an effort to diminish all Christians. The fact is the guy is nuts and no more represents Christians than the Liberal Unabomber Ted Kazinsky represents all liberals.      In fact, if you want to consider who does represent a Christian in the event, then look no further than the University of Colorado Police Officer taht ran INTO PP to help. He was by all reports a great Father and dedicated Christian who went into the clinic to HELP. Why is it you choose to overlook this truth and instead try and label all christains as whackos by a misguided association that simply isn't there.
2016-04-07	Joel Barr You do realize that this is exactly why Muslims hate when terrorists are called Islamic terrorists.
2016-04-07	This FRAUD exposed nothing but the innocence of Planned Parenthood and the moral bankruptcy of these Anti-Abortion LIARS. The guy is a criminal he was indicted there needs to be a thorough investigation of his criminal activities.      These skanky Susn B Anthony con artists get away with lying like this because the moron base of the GOP just drinks thier kool-aid and has not grip on reality.      these Planned ParentHood tapes were thoroughly debunked as edited fruads, there is NO TRUTH to these outrageous claims and Planned Parenthood should sue these frauds from the Susan B Anthony List for slander and defamation for continuing to pass along proven lies.
2016-04-07	And yet, Republican dominated state legislatures are STILL passing laws based on what everyone KNOWS (except for the wackobirds) to be false. Pretty pathetic.
2016-04-07	Robert Strawbrich Not for long.
2016-04-07	Robert Strawbrich Republicans have investigated Planned Parenthood and you know if they had found anything wrong at all they would have shouted it to the world but if even they couldn't find anything wrong when they looked as hard as they could (and you know they did!) then there was nothing wrong to be found!

2016-04-07	Hillary, when someone asks you if Bernie is qualified to be president, the correct answer is, "Yes. Yes I do." Any other answer means no. When you answer "no," don't feign outrage when your opponent responds similarly.
2016-04-07	,,and spare us the feigned outrage when he does
2016-04-07	Exactly. It's also a VERY easy question to fake if you think the person isn't qualified because technically any natural born American over the age of 35 and a resident of the USA for at least 14 continuous years prior to running for office is "qualified" to be President.      She was intentionally disrespecting the Bern. The Bern doesn't feel that. You feel the Bern.
2016-04-07	And what should Bernie say? #hypocryte. At least with Hillary someone was trying to goat her, Bernie went there on script and on purpose. Shamefull.
2016-04-07	LOL... Bernie thinks New York Democrats are really going to believe that Hillary, of all people, is not qualified to be president... Apparently Bernie thinks "fighting like a New Yorker" means saying stupid shit that no one will take seriously... How desperate and pathetic....
2016-04-07	You are correct, she is a highly qualified Republican and would make a great conservative candidate. For some reason she is running as a Democrat but Reich Watch has produced a fascinating short film on this amazing Republican women; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sonlaKyK00Q      All condescension aside, if you are open minded enough to watch this video to the end I think it will be a real eye opener.

2016-04-07	New York’s unique, hothouse media environment is exacerbating the tensions. A brutal interview with the New York Daily News editorial board, in which the Vermont senator stumbled trying to explain how he would break up the biggest banks, led Clinton to question his basic understanding of the very issues he has been running on.      Read more: http://www.politico.com/.../sanders-clinton-democratic...      Nothing in the interview was brutal and nowhere did Sanders "stumble" but that's what the Corporate Media wants you to think.
2016-04-07	Hugh Johnson Good thing he never said that.
2016-04-07	Oh the "Corporate Media" The Mediaa establishment is against Sanders. Sound like a memeber of the Tea Party, ala Ted Cruz. Sanders is in the wrong political party for this Anti-Establishment bullshit
2016-04-07	Man, Bernie and fans sounding a lot like Repubs these days...it's the media's fault.
2016-04-07	I back HRC, but based on the way this article reads....Clinton's "reasoning" sounds stupid. She's mad becaue Bernie is fighting for NY? What was he supposed to do? She's mad because she feels constrained? Ummmm...what the hell does that even mean?      Regardless, the whole thing is starting to get chippy. But even with that, it is no where near the mess that the GOP has. Tweeting pictures of people's wives and comparing schlongs...what a mess.
2016-04-07	She is terrified of losing again and angry that Bernie isn't stepping aside and letting her win.
2016-04-07	Adam Sinclair How "Presidential"...she looks very desperate lately, and Bernie has been taking it easy on her. What would she look like if pressure was on to regulate Wall St., curtail privatized prisons and cut weapons funding?
2016-04-07	Very well said. I support Bernie but I'm not ready to point fingers at either him nor' Hillary. Needless to say, none of this will necessary matter because the GOP has already shot themselves in the foot and they're almost done bleeding out.
2016-04-07	Bernie is now sounding like an old man screeming obsenities on his front lawn, and his supporters are getting worse than Trump supporters. And i was auctually gonna vote for him at one point.
2016-04-07	Actually long ago I use to like what he said but now I can't even stand to watch him. And also I have a problem with his so call progressive label when he repeatedly voted against gun control. That is NOT the vote of a progressive.

2016-04-07	Well Billy, when your policies turn the US into the largest prison state in the world, when your signature legislation after eight years is welfare reform (which led to loss of security without corresponding job training), and when your policies reduced regulation which allowed Wall Street to run rampant...      then I guess I understand the protesters' point more than I do the Clintons. If Bill had been more interested in helping the American people rather than freeing his willy to indulge his libertine ways, none of the above might have happened.      There's a reason Richard Mellon Scaithe, the Clintons' longtime nemesis, who spent millions trying to destroy him, admitted after Bill left office that he had been worried about nothing--that Clinton governered as a Republican-lite while in office, much more than Scaithe could have ever dreamed of.
2016-04-07	I find myself in a quandry defending Bill Clinton, but you are seriously delusional about these issues. The thing that turned the US into the largest prison population is the criminals. Gee, poor babies. I guess the evil laws forced them to be drug dealers, thieves, and murderers. All people had to do was not break the law and they wouldn't be in jail. And by the way, when criminals are in jail, they are not preying on the honest citizens of this country. Not that you would care about that. Welfare was never supposed to be a way of life.

The truth is more troubling.

Well, let me, let me just say in response to Secretary Clinton: I don't believe that she is qualified, if she is, through her SUPER PAC, taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds. I don't think that you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your super PAC."

2016-04-07	Andrew Soullier... they stole Clinton's campaign voter data. According to the logs, the Sanders staff harvested data and created [from scratch] no fewer than 24 lists that consisted entirely of data pulled down from the Clinton campaign’s database and saved them to their personal folders.
2016-04-07	Meika Shannon You know that how?
2016-04-07	They were so afraid that Sanders would get all the votes they had to steal the VAN. Now they want more time.

2016-04-07	Hugh Johnson You are either mistaken or you are a prevaricator. Birds of a feather I'm thinking. The DNC immediatly returned the VAN access to Bernie as soon as he sued. They knew who was in the wrong. It's why they are trying to drag it out by asking for more time. If Bernie is in the wrong, and they are there in court, why drag their feet? Because the DNC was in the wrong to steal the VAN from the Bernie campaign because they were so afrad of his organizing abilities. Hill has to cheat or she would lose. It's clear as a bell.

He founded the firm in 1998 with his brother John, formerly chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, then counselor to President Barack Obama, Mr. Podesta is the very definition of a Democratic insider.

Hillary pushed hard for that Panama treaty that she was extremely against when she was senator.      Bernie, on the other hand, stood on the floor of the Senate and asked what the treaty is really about, because no treaty with a nation who's GDP is less than one tenth of one percent of ours should be made to look so important. Unless it's because it allows the wealthiest among us to hide money from taxation.

2016-04-07	''Using a broad interpretation of the post-9/11 USA Patriot Act, Trump writes in the memo that he would threaten to issue new regulations that would compel money transfer companies like Western Union to verify a client’s identity and legal status before authorizing a wire transfer.''      So thats what the patriot act was for ,   he can take over and destroy western union   like he has destroyed so many other businesses   Think of all the other companies he can control also, He and his friends will make trillions
2016-04-07	Gee Hank, how many buildings are called Marcus Tower?
2016-04-07	Bruce Kapito Thank god Hank and most of us don't have to put our name on every freaking thing. Soooo boring. Wine, steak and on and on... A classic narcissist. Megalomaniac! Not something to be admired to me.
2016-04-07	Bruce Kapito : Those who cannot distinguish between power and money, have never had either, Kapito.
2016-04-07	Well he just won me over to Trump. He should really keep his big mouth shut.
2016-04-07	Like you weren't there already, please.
2016-04-07	Wow... I read that and thought great, the Mexicans are sick and tired of being bad-mouthed and finally answering back. So glad I've seen enough of Trump to never, ever support him. And you'd let an ex president of Mexico decide your vote? Idiot...
2016-04-07	Michele Lea Morin Do you not see that Mexico is afraid that if Trump wins, they will loose their power & money game that they have been holding onto for years? It's not that difficult to see, but you have your hate for Trump blinders on... Think first of USA Freedoms, instead of hate of a person named Trump.
2016-04-07	I don't believe the words of another failed latin American politician carry much weight. The moochers south of the border can't contain their fear any longer. The Donald is about to put America and Americans first...
2016-04-07	lol, the moochers? as in the 80% of welfare recipients who are Caucasian or African-American? those moochers?
2016-04-07	Benito Martinez And what percentage of welfare recipients of Mexico are hispanic. 100%? Americans have seen how "hispanics" have trashed their own countries. You thought Americans would sit by and watch our country trashed as well???
2016-04-07	Except Lyin Ted, that's not what you meant. You were in Iowa and you said Trumo's values are like New York and New Yorkers values. You were trying to cater to the rural voters in Iowa and are now trying to lawyer your way out of a bad statement.
2016-04-07	Yeah, he wasn't referring to corruption or democratic governance. He was referring to socially liberal. Dog whistle being I hate the gays and non religious more than Trump.
2016-04-07	NEVER TRUST-TED
2016-04-07	The way Trump usesw the term "Lyin' Ted" is a classic example of andproof he is actually a progressive. Whenever the left wishes to smear Christians, they always start by saying " There they are holding up their Bible, then they set it down in front of them and start to lie" That characterization is EXACTLY the one Trump uses to describe Cruz. His answer to Chris Matthews about punishing women for having an abortion is what Progressive think pro-life conservatives want to see happen although it is totally false. Trump demonstrates over and over he is not a conservative but a progressive an...See More
2016-04-07	I think New Yorkers understood exactly what Cruz meant by "New York values" - it sounded suspiciously like the old "San Francisco values" smear.
2016-04-07	Ask Trump what it means....HE used the term.
2016-04-07	As an Upstate New Yorker, I completely understand Ted Cruz comments on New York values. New York is one of the most corrupt states run by Mafia politicians like Coomo, DeBlasio and the corrupt Democrats. New York is still the highest taxed and most regulated state in the country. Simply stated- New York values will destroy the United States.
2016-04-07	You might want to move to one of the single voweled Red States. You know, the ones with the worst education ratings, lowest wages, high unemployment, and lowest per capita GDP. Those states keep taxes low with low rates and lilttle to no income. That would be great.      Oh yes, those same states take more cash from the federal government than they contribute. Those lovely states are takers, if not part of the 47%.

2016-04-08	so super delegate isn't democratic, but caucus system is?      Hyprocritic one trick poney. Sanders, go home.

2016-04-08	Could you explain "hyprocritic"? There may be a few people wondering.
2016-04-08	Wonder when the media is going to start talking about a contested convention on the democrat side?
2016-04-08	Karel Von Ascheberg This is great. You are starting to sound as deranged as Trump cultists. Hillary and Trump are like choosing between two rotten foods. Hopefully both of these candidates get sent to the dustbin of history this year.
2016-04-08	Jay Garver when Bernie can surpass Hillary in pledged delegates.
2016-04-08	Cheryl Onstad - In other words, never. :-/
2016-04-08	"there are only roughly 41,000 registered Democrats in the entire state — Bernie's path to victory is through making sure college students come out to vote." - LOL That's the story of Bernie's ENTIRE campaign. A bunch of easily swayed impressionable college kids. The New York media has already taken a bite out of Sanders, those news sharks smell blood in the water. Bernie can't even answer questions about how he intends to fulfill his promises.      He can attack Hillary with LIES all he wants, Bernie is burnt toast come April 19th
2016-04-08	She will be in jail before the CA primary
2016-04-08	That's right. Bernie fires up his naive college kid base with pie in the sky ideas like free tuition, universal healthcare, and closing down the banks on Wall St, but none of it is true, makes any sense, or is implementable in the real world. After NY it will be all over for socialist Sanders.
2016-04-08	Let the record show that bob considers most european countries to be outside the real world.
2016-04-08	Wyoming who? Wyoming is irrelevant. After NY and the majority of its 99 delegates are won by Hillary, it will be all over but the crying for socialist Sanders and his nasty hippies.
2016-04-08	At least get the F'in delegate count right New York has 247 delegates up for grabs, sanders is starting to win the race, get over it.   All the polling is tilting in his favor, and that sometimes does not even include the independent vote, which he has   Hillary Supporters need to remember Super's do not make up their mins to July. If it looks like Sanders has a better chance at defeating the GOP, than HIll, they will swap to him.   Neither one of them is going to hit the target without the Super vote, so neither will quit before july
2016-04-08	Wyoming has two senators. Billions in resorces and the most beautiful national park in the world. One of the last places on earth where you can find wild bison and wild wolves. Of course hill-bots like you think it's irrelevant. I'm sure most fake progressives do. That's why she will lose Wyoming and lose the nomination.
2016-04-08	Seaason Violi - you just bugging!! He will not win NY, we know whats happenin in our stoops!!
2016-04-08	Wyoming is one of those 33 states where the state democratic party laundered super pac donations for Clinton in exchange for 10 percent going to super delegate campaign funds      There is nothing democratic about that or how Clinton operates. The problem she has is people who vot for Sanders actually LIKE HIM      Clintons are all about the Clintons. Voters finally found authenticity in Sanders and her surrogate goon strategy and tactics only piss them off
2016-04-08	that explains her huge lead, doesn't it?
2016-04-08	Michael Tucker there is a nice summary on young turks. $26 Million
2016-04-08	Michael Tucker Low informed voters name recognition explain it. That is changing which explains her shrinking lead.
2016-04-08	probably a better title for this story would be...."Insiders: 90 percent predict HIJACKED GOP convention"
2016-04-08	These are the rules. The poorly educated are ruining this country with their ignorance.
2016-04-08	None of the candidates will reach the required majority, it must go to the convention. If your guy is not able to get the majority needed before the convention, he will compete with my guy at the convention. No hijacking involved.
2016-04-08	Kathy Jane Bullshit. If Rubio had Trumps number of delegates, he would be the GOP's guy like 4 months ago. This is why you people are hated. You always deny the truth. Yeah it is true that all bets are off if Trump does not get to 1237, but the fact is any other candidate would have been given the green light. You are totally full of it and obviously are pulling for one of the other losers.
2016-04-08	Prediction: Kasich will team up with New Mexico governor Susana Martinez. The appeal of that ticket as a Hillary-killer will convince even Trump and Cruz delegates to go for it on a fourth or fifth ballot. Ted Cruz can walk away feeling good that no longer does everybody hate him. Donald Trump can walk away feeling good that everybody does hate him.      If the Democrats cared about winning, faced with a Kasich-Martinez ticket, they would ditch the corruption queen and nominate Bernie Sanders in Philadelphia. But since most of the Democratic delegates are paid Clinton cronies, they'll nominate Clinton anyway and go down to a humiliating defeat.
2016-04-08	Not really likely at all. How did you dream up something about someone with less than 200 delegates winning the nomination?
2016-04-08	sadly, that does seem a likely outcome.
2016-04-08	Donald Filiault because the number of delegates one has only matters leading up to the first ballot at the convention.      Geoff, I'm not familiar with Gov. Martinez, but you just peaked my interest. If she's even just slightly more to the right than Kasich on some social issues, then that's a knockout ticket. I'd love to see it, and then maybe seem some actual work get done in DC.
2016-04-08	Insiders: 153% predict Democratic victory in November      No need for country to panic
2016-04-08	If Trump or Cruz are the nominee Hillary will win because the bulk of Republican won't vote for either of them. Myself included.
2016-04-08	Diane Henderson Thomas I know a few moderate Republicans who say the same thing. Theyre not Hillary fans but they know monsters when they see them.

2016-04-08	If Donald Trump manages to get a Democrat elected President with a Democratic Senate, turning the Supreme Court liberal for several generations, AND takes down Fox News on top of all that, he will deserve to be carved into Mount Rushmore.
2016-04-08	this will turn into the world's biggest bore   instead of floor-fights, there will be mass twitter feeds and lemmings following their facebook posts
2016-04-08	Oh, I don't know about that. I think democrats should donate a bunch of coconut cream pies to the delegates and see what happens.
2016-04-08	No Trump's terrorist network is planning riots      Longtime Donald Trump ally Roger Stone is threatening to make public the hotel room numbers of Republican National Convention delegates who switch from Trump to another candidate.
2016-04-08	"If you’re from Pennsylvania, we’ll tell you who the culprits are. We urge you to visit their hotel and find them. You have a right to discuss this, if you voted in the Pennsylvania primary, for example, and your votes are being disallowed," Stone said.
2016-04-08	It's a pretty minor case, at most imo he gets community service and probation.
2016-04-08	there's absolutely no way in hell that Lawandowski can be of any service to the community
2016-04-08	Ch Hoffman When he's out on the side of the road picking up trash during a hot and humid Florida summer, he'll be of some minimal service.
2016-04-08	Ch Hoffman live target on a firing range. lunch in the lion's den. there are ways.
2016-04-08	This shouldn't be in a court room. Mr. Lewandowski did nothing out of the ordinary as is evident in the vidieo tape. The "reporter" is a liberal hack making up stories. Throw this case in the trash where it belongs.
2016-04-08	Hey jazz man. She wasn't a liberal hack. She worked for Breitbart. She was a libertarian, or is rather. But let's say she was. Doesn't matter. What does someone's politics have to do with the merit of a case? Idiot. It's a minor case, but you have no clue the definition of battery in Florida. You can't go grabbing anyone you want to because you don't like what they are doing and pull them aside. He did it forcefully enough btw to stop her. I think it is also funny he contributed to Hillarys campaign because the Donald has also contributed to her campaign in the past. Even Steven. Trumps rhetoric of "I wish I could punch them in the face" and "in the old days they would be taken out on a stretcher" finally materialized. You had the one supporter sucker punch the protestor. And now this. Just because you don't like what someone says doesn't give anyone the right to assault them. TRUMP = EGOTISTICAL, NARCISISTIC BULLY.
2016-04-08	Are you afraid they will use polictacal bias to prosecute the same way you used your bias to comment....It is better to say nothing when you have nothing to say then to say something and leave no doubt you have nothing to say
2016-04-08	Michelle Fields a liberal?? You fucking moron lol.....
2016-04-08	The tape clearly shows he grabbed her. After he lied about it, said he never touiched her and called her delusional. Tapes dont lie.
2016-04-08	Seth Koch. Better get yourself a good pair if glasses and view it again
2016-04-08	Francine Petersen you need to watch the video without the Trump filter on your glasses. Watch as Fields is pulled from her walking path, which by the way was in front of a Secret Service agent who apparently had no problem with her being there. You see, it matters not HOW HARD Lewandowski pulled, it's that he pulled at all. It was neither his job nor in his best interest to even touch the reporter, it makes for and has made bad press. This all would've gone away with a simple apology, but Trump and his staff NEVER apologize, it's in his creed.
2016-04-08	Phil Lisi "the Trump Filter" LOL!!
2016-04-08	Clinton supporter prosecuter? He's hosed. Headed to Fort LeavenWorth.   see Perry and Delay, indicted, failed prosecution. It's the way dems do business.

2016-04-08	The Pope probably couldn't afford Hillary's $225,000 speaking fee.
2016-04-08	Bernie Sanders is the only candidate talking about wealth inequality and how to fix it.      Hillary is telling us to lower our expectations and settle for baby steps.

2016-04-08	Barbara Barlow His solution is to raise taxes to pay for "free stuff". Which isnt a bad thing.
2016-04-08	Jacob Crim "Free stuff" is a gross oversimplification. Nothing is free and everyone would pay for their stuff.

2016-04-08	Ytap Gaspar Jaimes Yea, he got it right about penalizing women for abortion and proliferating nuclear weapons in Asia to start an arms race. The most disliked candidate in the country according to polls. He's a bigot and racist and right in tune with his GOP followers, but not with America.
2016-04-08	Michael Iger you are idiot , he said he would much rather ppl pay up for their nato support, but if they dont pay up then they gotta defend themselves. then you start talking some nonsense to do with abortion, For which was a hyperthetical question. "if abortion was illegal , Then.."      saying stuff like bigot and racist is nothign but smears that have no basis in reality. Calling for deporting illegal immigrants does not make you a racist, Islam is not a race, its a religon. And its a fact that there are many unvetted muslims entering the country, especially from europe and syria. IF you want a president that gambles with the lifes of its ppl, go and vote for a 3rd obama term or the socialist who will bring USA into massive massive debt.
2016-04-08	Michael Iger Trump said he would penalize "doctors" who abort not according to current government laws. HE DID NOT SAY HE WOULD PENALIZE WOMEN. THE MSM EDITED THAT PART OUT.
2016-04-08	Drumpf the first to use social media??? Did he forget how Obama raised more with ONLINE donations than any candidate when he first ran?? All of them are using social media.. Drumpf just retweets racist crap the most!
2016-04-08	Obama had a ground game. Trump only has Twitter. No one else has used social media any better than my mom.
2016-04-08	He didn't forget, he never knew it. He was so busy telling himself how wonderful he was he couldn't take in any thng that involved anybody else.

2016-04-08	Robert George then he shouldn't have made the commitment! It's not like this is the first time he's bailed on a comitted event. His time would be better spent filing bankrupticies to help fill his coffers with other people's money.

2016-04-08	It will not come together. How does the Donald win a general election, forgetting the democrats that will vote against him, when 25 percent OR BETTER of us republicans will just stay home. Guys like Hannity and Limbaugh, whom I have a hard time listening to anymore, just do not get that and try to portray us conservatives as "establishment". Pretty simple for me, I am conservative and Trump is a liberal disguised in sheep's clothing. Not rocket science. Oh yeh, then there is the 70 percent negative rating, that will not change.
2016-04-08	Trump will energize the lazy voters once he is nominated.
2016-04-08	Wow! I'm a successful business woman and just got back from a Boston trade show and was connecting to more woman in business that loves trump and I'm talking very successful and some not so much..why is he the front runner then since last June? I think some of those polls saying that 70 percent unfavorable are just fabricated bullcrap..do you know what I know and I won't tell you how I know? Well he will be the republican nominee !
2016-04-08	Jack Zaccardi, and once 'energized' they will no longer be lazy voters and, hence, not Trump supporters, eh?
2016-04-08	He made his point. He'll move on. If she runs her mouth again, he'll return to it.
2016-04-08	Exactly! He made his point that he's a moron (anyone who takes offense at a headline, in the Washington Post, no less). Now, about that "immoral" GE. Since they're undermining the fabric of American society, Sanders would probably be happy to see them close their Vermont facility and move to a state that would appreciate those 1000+ jobs. Such a moron!

2016-04-08	The fix is in for Carpetbagger Clinton. Attorney General Lapdog Lynch will never let a criminal complaint against Carpetbagger Clinton go forward, and Carpetbagger Clinton knows it.

2016-04-08	Really Ted (Canadian) Cruz is the ultimate carpetbagger
2016-04-08	The FBI doesn't do "security reviews"; they do investigations - Federal Bureau of INVESTIGATIONS.
2016-04-08	Lou Kaye Of course not, but she can't even be honest that there is a criminal investigation ongoing. An investigation where someone has been given immunity.
2016-04-08	Carter Smith Apparently she has been given immunity...
2016-04-08	Lou Kaye Please cite a source where many have gone on the record.
2016-04-08	The numbers will may tighten, but it most likely won't matter. Sanders needs big wins, not tight losses (or even tight wins).      He's going to romp through Wyoming by 30, then lose NY by 6, and at the point, it will be the end (again). Sanders will say momentum on on his side based on where the polls said he was 3 months ago vs the results, and he will continue on.      My guess is he will lose the next block in a close one as well, and that should certify the end of the campaign (but he won't stop). He would be left in a position of needed to win Cali by +50 points, and that isn't going to happen.      Hopefully the race stays fairly friendly.
2016-04-08	An indictment would make a +50 Sanders win possible.      Just saying.

2016-04-08	Regardless of the outcome, the fact that Clinton is not talking up the importance of business interests and promoting the TPP is a big win. Thank God for Bernie Sanders. (I still think he can win and want him to.)

2016-04-08	Just keep fooling yourself out of facts. About 2.4 milion voted for Clinton. He will not get enough delegates to stop her, it is a math thingy.
2016-04-08	I see that Bernie has the young college supporters. However, they don't seem to be very good at math.
2016-04-08	In 2008,Secretary Clinton won 10 big contests in a row. She was only 108 elegates behind. This makes for good press, but like Secretary Clinton in 2008, his contest was over in March. He is mathmatecallynearly impossible. It's a better narrative to say he has a difficult path. Unless some unforseen event happens, it's over.
2016-04-08	He needs 57% of the remaining delegates. That's not over, that's still a competitive race. We can talk about over if she beats him by 10 points in NY. I don't think that will happen.   It will come down to California.
2016-04-08	Jesse Del Quadro You do know that there is PA, NJ, IL and MY primaries coming up don't you? Do you really think Bernie will win by YUGE margins in those primaries?
2016-04-08	Jesse Del Quadro it 67%
2016-04-08	If Bernie didn't win the nomination, I could vote for a bunch of other Dems in the General. But I can't vote for another Clinton in the White House...especially her. I know a lot of her supporters hate that, but really...if it were Bernie and O'malley...I could support O'malley afterwards. I just can't vote for Hillary. I hate her positions. I hate how she's been every side of every issue. I hate that she seems bought by big business (2/3's of her campaign funding is from business that liberals tend to loathe...WS, Prisons, Oil, Pharma, etc, etc). With such high dislikability facters in her equation, how did the DNC think corronating her (Yet another huge gripe for Bernie supporters...The DNC has done everything in it's power to skew results in Hillary's favor) would make the liberal base (I guess the "base" for Dems is actually "moderate" instead...both parties have shifted far right over decades) upset.
2016-04-08	yes, it is REALLY sad that America did not get to know Martin O'Malley better. Honestly he is such a hard working and genuinely decent person. don't get me wrong, I really like Bernie, but before Martin dropped out, I was torn, honestly torn between them.
2016-04-08	They just assume that the liberal base will come along. That's why they court moderate independents so hard.
2016-04-08	Jesse Del Quadro The assumption is that the liberal base is composed of logical decision makers - are you saying the liberal base will actively shoot down any chance of progressive policies being inacted over the next 30+ years by not supporting the Dem candidate? How idiotic.
2016-04-08	And the recent SurveyUSA poll, which is from 3/30-4/3 (in contrast to the Field poll which started 3/24), suggests Hillary is up by 14% in CA. Surveys vary across pollsters. One would be mistaken in concluding that the race has tightened between the two polls given their overlap in data collection and the longer window for the Field poll.

2016-04-08	Michael Robinson except those states were caucuses, not primaries. Those states also have AA population of less than 7%. They have Latino population of less than 6%. California is decidely more diverse than that. He does great in caucuses. The turnout is mostly hardcore progressive. And low. Less than 3.9%- 6% of the electorate.

2016-04-08	Half the words that come out of Trumps mouth are a lie. No one know where he really stands on issues and the media have a duty to be skeptical of a man who has never held public office and is running for the highest seat in the country.

When I win votes, also same thing. When I lose it can't possibly be me... I was cheated. BS whiner... Yawn. Btw... I read at least a half dozen articles, some from those conservative rags, who must lie also, and this is what Dr. Ben said. The twisting is you bending over so far to believe BS you're about ready to snap in half. Groupie who wants to sleep with the enemy. Out of context and cherry-picking... Why that's your thing. Keep on whining.
2016-04-08	The established leadership of both the Republicans and Democrats are worrying that Trump is disrupting their power base and their version of the status quo. He is actually appealing to forgotten/ignored voters in both parties that have been taken for granted.      The leadership in both parties have been deadlocked for years. It's a good thing that someone like Trump "shakes things up…" If only for that reason, he's good for the country and this particular election process. If he only accomplishes a fraction of what he is talking about, it's a major plus for the country.      When the best that the D...See More
2016-04-08	It's just the opposite. Trump has used his celebrity to manipulate the media into more extended coverage of him than all the rest of the candidates combined. Despite all the whining, we know exactly what he is like, exactly where is coming from, and exactly what he is saying. The coverage is so extensive that there is no chance for quoting out of context because we don't get little snippets, we get the whole thing. Again and again. And the only think more scary than Trump are the people who support him no matter what he says and does. That's the kind of hero worship that has done in democracies again and again over history. I get why you are upset with the status quo.But you've got to find somebody who is worthy of that kind of support, and it absolutely ain't Trump. Better to go and vote third party like I have done for years than support a false prophet like Trump or status quo politicians.
2016-04-08	You must be drunk. Trump is a lying sociopath and if you think he believes anything he says...

2016-04-08	If the Cruzifix wants to start apologizing, he should begin with God and go from there. This wannabe Elmer Gantry, who is constantly quoting scripture, seems to have missed the whole point of Jesus' teachings.      There's a reason that horror maestro, Stephen King, said it is Cruz that keeps him awake at night. Couldn't agree more. If we ever adopt a position of Witchfinder General, we'll keep Ted in mind.      Otherwise, the last person you want to have the ability to trigger Armageddon is someone who believes in the Rapture. No telling when Ted might decide it is time to return home to "the great state of Heaven".
2016-04-08	Winston Herzog 'Cruzifix', love it....why didn't I think of that!
2016-04-08	Winston Herzog You did a great job with your comment. Thank you. I especially like "Cruzifix" and may use it myself -- very creative of you! Yes, Cruz is frightening. I would like to point out Cruz' Pentecostal preacher tendencies. . . Watch his hands -- he move them methodically across his body as he speakes. Watch his smile -- it comes at the end of each comment as if in punctuation. Watch his cadence -- his voice lowers as he reaches the end of each comment. His mannerisms are exactly the same as a Pentecostal preacher. He's a very dangerous man.
2016-04-08	“If we want to turn the country around, let me tell you who should apologize: Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton should apologize to the American people.” — Ted Cruz   For what exactly?

This incongruity between what he tells them and his dealings can't be comprehended by the simple folk, his followers. If successful he's going to go on and continue to make money for himself and his billionaire buddies at their expense.
2016-04-08	this is the kind of reporting that the media should be doing instead of rinsing/repeating every idiotic statement he makes. trump talks a lot about what he's going to do...but nobody seems to spend a lot of effort digging into the details of what he's done.

2016-04-08	I was surprised to hear somewhere in media (forgot where, but it was last week) that there's no indications that Trump has ever been a racist.

2016-04-08	What the hell does that even mean -- true constitutional conservative? Fear him more as a dominionist.
2016-04-08	The only problem with all of these rants by the author is Cruz has never once said he, as President would try to impose his will on the people. However, he has repeatedly said the PEOPLE, not the government or unelected judges should not be making decision about policy and people's lives. Cruz is a Constitutional Conservative which means he beleives the government should be limited to the powers granted to it by the words of the Constitutition, not the courts who have also went far beyond their role of intepreting the law to writing or rewriting it. Progressives cannot stand anyone who demands we go back to following the Constitution because it limits the powers of the Federal government which means they cannot use it and the courts to impose on the people those views and values they choose to reject.
2016-04-08	"Constitutional Conservative which means he believes the government should be limited to the powers granted to it by the words of the Constitutition, not the courts who have also went far beyond their role of intepreting the law to writing or rewriting it,which means he believes the government should be limited to the powers granted to it by the words of the Constitutition, not the courts who have also went far beyond their role of intepreting the law to writing or rewriting it"?      PROVE IT! You cannot, so we see " Constitutional Conservative" = bald-faced liar and fool.
2016-04-08	Are any of the "rants" untrue? Tell us how the Citizens United decision was constitutionally conservative. Where in the constitution does it say that free speech and money are really the same thing and deserve the same protection? If you don't like it here, move to Mexico...
2016-04-08	Bruce Tieman - Tell you what Bruce, if you think you are so informed and intelligent prove Frank Wrong.
2016-04-08	Conservatives are reactionary, as the topic shows. They create and contibute nothing. They only react in opposition to whatever comes along. This is because conservatives by definition "reist change", and, because of that, cannot lead. When a conservative is confronted by a fact that contradicts their opinon, they deny the fact, and are therefore dishonest.
2016-04-08	Prove it! Guess what, you cannot do it. Sucks to be you and called on by your own little petty game now doesn't it? You can try until you are blue in the face, but you cannot prove a word of what you just wrote. Keep in mind that opions are not fact and do not prove anything. So more of your worthless opinion is not needed.
2016-04-08	Todd Smith, I cannot prove a word of what I just wrote? Try a dictionary where it says "conservatives by definition 'reist change'". I doubt you have the intelligence to read a dictionary definition.
2016-04-08	Bruce.. Surely you realize your description of conservatives is a perfect description of not just your post, but also of the other post on here that are bashing conservatives.   Others have attempted to answer or reply, however all you seem to know is bash and insult. I have to assume it makes you feel smart although you haven't contributed a single useful thought to the conversation.
2016-04-08	Too conservative and just too crazy...a Dominionist who believes he is hand picked by "God" to be president and that government should be run according to the bible....HIS interpretation of the bible. We are a democracy, not a theocracy. This man is despised by every one of his peers, yet, he is the viable alternative to the Dumpster? Party before country when you belong to the GOP, I guess. A truly dangerous individual who will set the country back 100 years with his cuckoo religious views.
2016-04-08	Lol look at who your party is running moron, a communist called Sanders hahaha. And you have the audacity to attack a constitutionalist conservative? F U libby!
2016-04-08	Brian Kourdou WOW, what a mature, educated, informed response....proving the point that no one is so useless that they can't at least serve as a good example. Have a nice day.
2016-04-08	Brian Kourdou -- you just the type to love drumpf and cruzz.
2016-04-08	Of course Cruz is too conservative to be elected. The majority of American voters rejected conservative Republican candidates in both 2008 and 2012 and elected Obama twice. What is it that you don't get about where the majority of Americans are politically?
2016-04-08	Because if Politico's writers wrote what they really felt - that Justin Bieber has a better chance of becoming Putin's Defense Minister than Cruz has in getting elected President - the Wingnuts would stop coming here      Ergo...........this tripe.      (Update: They changed the title from the moronic "Is Cruz Too Conservative To Be Elected)
2016-04-08	actually Obama lost the popular vote the second time. and to add the rest of the story, Dems have lost close to 1000 seats nationwide since Obama took office. So.. what was that about the majority again?

2016-04-08	lol
2016-04-08	Trump is a dumbass and has always been one. Just like his policies; were going to build a wall, im great, and im up in this poll. Thats all he knows. He is just a big loud mouth liar and bigot. Dump Trump.
2016-04-08	Nathan, so you hate Trump. Look at the choices we have, if you think good ol Ted would be better choice, think again. As for Hillary or Sanders you gotta be insane to vote for. (35 yrs Dem. first time Repu)
2016-04-08	Andy Lundberg, there is a guy named Kasich in the race.
2016-04-08	Andy Lundberg You can always vote for Alfred E. Newman or someone you think is worthy of the Presidency.
2016-04-08	Here, let me respond on Trump's behalf: "This is totally unfair. Yet another attempt to steal the election. Sad!"
2016-04-08	Because he and his campaign don't know what the hell they are doing it always becomes unfair in their heads, unfair when you turn your homework in late. What idiots.
2016-04-08	He's best for the job yet he's fighting everyone against him. Oddly he isn't canadian didn't marry his cousin or cheat on his wife or cheat many times over in this process yet he's the bad one? Oh my I worry about the future of this country more every day.
2016-04-08	Kristi Stannard I kind of like the fact he isn't a seasoned politicIan liar. What's wrong with that?
2016-04-08	Stupid is as stupid does.
2016-04-08	No need to apologize... BLM needs to go try their luck with the Republicans....
2016-04-08	Donald Weber -- Jesus! All you people have is impotent teabagger one-liners.... LOL....

2016-04-08	Carl Rice How is it thjat more unarmed, white males get killed by police, but you don't see white people chanting white lived matter? Then agin, obey the law and the police won't have to come into your neighborhoods.

2016-04-08	Actually, the 2 BLM protesters were there for about 30 minutes quietly holding their signs when they were surrounded by several Hillary supporters telling them to drop there signs. It started to worsen as some started pushing them and trying to grab their signs. That's when they started yelling. Just a bit of context.
2016-04-08	Was that before or after they called his wife a murderer. Just a bit of context.
2016-04-08	Thanks Bradley, Is there a source for that?
2016-04-08	Clinton has nothing to apologize for in that matter... But just in that matter
2016-04-08	Oh it's OK woman abuser, of course the funny thing is that you clowns created The Obama Savage Movement.. Enjoy the irony..

2016-04-08	How about those nuclear codes? Give him "The Button" and dare him to press it.
2016-04-08	So will The Donald be entering Twee-hab to overcome this compulsion?
2016-04-08	ahh yes the liberal media clearly forcing trump to tweet...not like trump has had his foot permanetly planted in his mouth for 30 years
2016-04-08	lol
2016-04-08	So much wrong with this story in regards to trump:      1. his advisors apparently have to babysit him so he doesn't say stupid shit on twitter or post quotes from fascist dictators      2. trump is so thin-skinned and unable to control his actions that all the media has to do is say something bad about him and they can get him to fly off the handle... great temperament for a president.      3. when ben carson is the reasonable voice in your corner, you know you're in bat shit crazy fantasy land
2016-04-08	Why do we not want The Fourth Estate to have responsible Control over that man?
2016-04-08	The lame brain political drop out chimes in with more worthless tripe.
2016-04-08	Senator Barry Goldwater said this in 1994. " Mark my words if and when prechers get control of the GOP and they are sure trying to do so it is going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromies. But these Christians believe there are acting in the name of god so they won't compromise. I know I have tried to deal with them". This is about Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Sentaor Ted Cruz of Texas. Senator Goldwater saw the writing on the wall.
2016-04-08	On top of that a District Court found Governor Walker's right to work law unconstitutional. It is not over but you just can't fix stupid.
2016-04-08	Neal Levine He certainly did. My Dad was a big Goldwater fan for partially this reason. Don't you hate it when Dad is always right? LOL
2016-04-08	never mind those pesky voters of which Trump has 2M more of them than Cruz
2016-04-08	Rules are rules. Trump has never gotten the majority of votes in a primary and he won't ever get the support of the majority of delegates. Consequently, Trump will not be the republican nominee.
2016-04-08	Also has the highest DISapproval rating of the lot. There, I fixed it for you.
2016-04-08	dont worry if is go to second ballot only kachy will win the nomination. GOP hate cruz more than trump
2016-04-08	Cruz might do worse than Trump. Dude is WAY too far to the right for the general.
2016-04-08	I agree. Trump would get some crossover, even from Democrats. The Cruzifix, however, will make the Goldwater run look competitive. Plus, it will lay to rest, at long last, the Teabagger fantasy that the GOP's problem is that they keep nominating guys who aren't crazy...eh, conservative...enough. Crush Cruz...end the dream.
2016-04-08	Tell me something I don't know?
2016-04-08	As a registered conservative for over 40 years, and, mind you, a real registered conservative, a William Buckley conservative, it's not possible for Ted Cruz to be anything more than a mouth piece for the far right wing nuts and looney bins who have so greatly altered conservative values. He, and those who sponsor and/or endorse his campaign, fail to comprehend that to govern requires sane, sensible, and practical solutions to the problems that face our nation. God help us if he ever becomes more than just the junior senator from the lunacy-ridden state of Texas.
2016-04-08	You are not a real conservative if you think Ted Cruz is a "right wing nut". You are obviously a RINO.
2016-04-08	John B. Andelin A bagger definition of a RINO: Anyone who doesn't behave like a total asshole.
2016-04-08	John B. Andelin because he is right wing nut
2016-04-08	People in Glass houses should not throw stones. He say he is surging in the polls but always end in 3rd place. He says Ohio is doing great but not really. He says when he becomes emperor he will close teachers lounges because it is a hot bed of dissent. I thought he was running for President.

2016-04-08	Gurpreet Singh SPAM and SCAM. You've committed both.
2016-04-08	Ever noticed that Kasich thinks he is better than the other two candidates? The voters are not buying it.   Kasich has lost about 32 times.......so that makes Kasich a loser.
2016-04-08	Is that how you vote for president? Based on who others voted for? Who are you voting for, the person being investigated by the FBI or the vulgarian who wants everyone to have a nuclear weapon? Kasich has the most experience, a good record and is a moderate.

2016-04-08	Yeah, Trump and Cruz are crazy, but Kasich was lining his pocket as a Wall St. investment banker at Lehman Brothers while his firm was engaged in the very risky derivative trading that nearly made our banking industry and economy collapse during the Bush years. Lehman Brothers was forced to file for bankruptcy and was in such bad shape that it could not qualify for bailout funds.

I'm an American, not a socialist, so success isn't "despicable" to me.
2016-04-08	Aaron Solomon How on earth can you be inspired by an orange clown who absolutely can't talk about anything except his 'fabulous' poll numbers. He's an embarrassment to our party - mostly because he is a democrat!! #nevertrump
2016-04-09	How does Bernie think releasing a list of delegates that is clearly almost 700 behind Hillary's total works to his benefit. It just reminds everyone how far behind he is. Bernie is getting bad advice.
2016-04-09	Cheryl Onstad. It matters because the superdelegates provide much of her lead. They will have the opportunity to choose at the convention.
2016-04-09	Mark Allen Fisher That is true. But what Bernie's campaign is doing is hurting the Dem party that they say they're willing to unite at the end of this. First Bernie has to catch up in pledged delegates and that's not going to happen. THEN he could make the argument that he's their guy. Putting this out now, saying they plan for a fight at the convention is not good for anyone, including Bernie. It makes him look like the political opportunist he assures us he's not.      I suspect this is all Jeff Weaver, who is not doing Bernie any favors, and is behind many of Bernie's stumbles this week. It appears the Bernie campaign wants to win at all costs, November be damned.
2016-04-09	Cheryl Onstad Why does Bernie have to catch up in pledged delegates? There are enough superdelegates to bridge a substantial gap if Hillary is seen as a candidate who would do poorly in the general.
2016-04-09	Stop lumping the delegate totals together, Politico. This is a ploy to make the gap seem wider. Report Hillary's pledged delegates. That would illustrate the increasingly strong probability that this will come down to undemocratic superdelegates.
2016-04-09	Mark Allen Fisher, in this case it was Bernie's campaign who spoke of both pledged and supers.
2016-04-09	Hugh Johnson They are not democratically selected. Yes, I understand the process.
2016-04-09	Hugh Johnson how are super delegates democratic, Hug??
2016-04-09	Wyoming has a TOTAL of 14 delegates. Bernie could win them all and Hillary would still be 200 pledged delegates ahead of him.      He's been claiming "momentum" since New Hampshire. It didn't help him in Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, etc. etc..      Hillary has the majority of pledged delegates available to date, and will continue to have the majority at the end of the primaries. I'm not sure if Bernie is delusional or just really bad at math. Perhaps his campaign manager, Tad Devine, wants to keep this going as long as possible because of the big bucks he's getting out of it.

2016-04-09	He's won the last 8 states in a row, thats the momentum he's talking about. He just picked up wins in Missouri and Nevada this week as well, both states that voted Hilary months ago. He now has won more contests than Hillary has after these two switches.
2016-04-09	Pledged delegates Source AP (I've added unallocated Washington state pledged delegates):   Clinton: 1301   Sanders: 1107   Difference: 194      They still haven't properly allocated the Washington state delegates to the count, but I included them in my count as 71-30 hypothetically (Sanders won 71% of state vote). As of now the AP still reports Sanders having won 25 delegates and Clinton 9 out of 101 delegates.      Tonight: Wyoming 14 delegates   April 19: NY state 247 delegates   April 26: 384 total delegates on the line...See More

2016-04-09	Christine Bean You don't know that. The rest of Washington's delegates won't be released until the convention and an analysis shows it might net Bernie 30 more delegates.
2016-04-09	Wyoming has a total of 14 Pledged delegates. Bernie could win them all and Hillary would still be 200 pledged delegates ahead. She has the majority of pledged delegates available to date, and she will have the majority at the end of the primaries. Bernie is either delusional or really bad at math, and his campaign manager, Tad Devine, has a major $$$ incentive to keep Bernie in the race.      Bernie has been claiming momentum since New Hampshire. How did that work out for him in Nevada, South Carolian, Texas, Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, etc.?
2016-04-09	He won Nevada. And Democrats don't win Texas, SC, Florida, NC, LA, etc, in the general election. So who cares if Hillary is popular with republicans?
2016-04-09	Tim Steele, Hillary actually won Nevada.
2016-04-09	Tim Steele He lost Nevada and liking your own post is pathetic!

2016-04-09	Chad Sa And 9 of the precincts already reporting show a 50-50 split. This wasn't the day Bernie was looking for.

The IRS got off the hook for being used inappropriately against conservatives.

2016-04-10	Sanders said that "to the extent that Israel wants a good relationship with us, they have to improve their relations with the Palestinians." That's like telling Iraq that if it wants a good relationship with us, it needs to improve its relationship with ISIS.   Don't forget, when the Gazans elected Hamas to power, Hamas then violently eliminated the domestic political opposition -- Fatah -- mass shooting its members and throwing them off of roofs. Hamas has the announced goals of murdering as many Jews as possible and replacing Israel with an Islamic theocracy.

2016-04-10	Scott Rose So, if I understand this correctly, when a terrorist group attacks a State or Nation, the correct answer is retaliation against the entire population this terrorist group hides amongst, the destruction of their houses, blockade of their trade and the construction of a wall beyond their borders.      End of the day, after this populace has no access to information, education, welfare and other basic needs, it is their fault when they vote into power those very representatives that say they are fighting for them.      Got it.      And then, if you dare critisize such action, you are bigoted against the practisioners of a religion.      Totally comprehensive.

He received an invitation to speak at a small, invitation-only scholarly conference at the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences conference celebrating the 25th year anniversary of an encyclical “Centesimus Annus,” written by Pope John Paul II on the evils of capitalism.
2016-04-10	I thought Bernie was going to attend an academic conference at the Vatican. The invitation was not from the Pope, but from the academic institition PASS. Are you sure that he is meeting with the Pope? I was surprised when he said he was leaving to attend this academic conference in the days before the New York primary.

2016-04-10	Larry Paradis Yes, NEGATIVE. Those wins did very little to dent Hillary's lead, and she actually walked away from WY with more delegates 11-7. That's why you're seeing Bernie upping his attacks.      It might interest you to know that Hillary also had a string of wins after Obama got a comfortable lead.....at about 90 delegates over Hillary at this point in 2008.

2016-04-10	Does she plan to loose NY tooo?
2016-04-10	Ronald Charlton, WY wasn't really a loss for Clinton as they split the pledged delegates and Hillary has the support of 4 WY supers.      WY tally Clinton 11 - Bernie 7      This is why you see Bernie going ever more negative. He's scared.
2016-04-10	Cheryl Onstad it has been said over and over. Those super delegates don't count until we get to the convention. They can switch to Bernie. And you think Bernies going negative? The Clintons are a negativity machine.

2016-04-10	These laws are more about personal prejudices than to solve any real problem. Kasich is taking a reasoned approach which is refreshing in this instance instead of jumping on the band wagon. If a problem develops it can be addressed, not imagining one that's so far non-existent. I thought people wanted government out of their lives, that is unless they want to impose it on others lives. Its call hypocrisy in case you don't recognize it.

2016-04-10	Deivis Jaimes Trump pay you well for all that.
2016-04-10	if you have an "outy" you use the boys/mens room,......see how simple that is
2016-04-10	So you would be fine with Caitlin Jenner using the mens' room in your gym? Or do you just hate transgendered people in general (no fan of Jenner here. Just using her as an example ).
2016-04-10	Tom Fitzpatrick If she really wants to be a woman, she should complete her transformation. But the reason this law was written is because of a municipal law that would have permitted any man who just said he identified as a woman to enter a woman's bathroom. They could be wearing a man's suit and the law would have permitted them to do this. Sorry, but I am not that trusting of a person.
2016-04-10	Tom Fitzpatrick Yes. Especially since he used the men's room and the men's locker room all his life. I don't understand the problem with him continuing to use the men's restroom and locker room. Also, I believe he said he has no intention of having his parts removed, that he still likes his parts, so especially in that case I would say he needs to use the men's room.
2016-04-10	I am not completely informed of what this law does or doesn't do ...   And as the father of two daughters, and the Grandfather of three girls   As well a human who is very aware of how male predators will use any   loophole to satisfy their perverted desires ...   Would not want a law that allows what was born male, to have any reason   to be in the same room where these children deserve complete privacy   If for the reason of fairness someone chooses to change what they are   Then build a third toilet for that group ...   Problem solved ... !
2016-04-10	Amon Amarth Any dirty old man can claim to be transgendered and use the ladies room. How are you going to stop him? Do the transgendered need to be in a dress? Why? You can't tell people what to wear. Do they need a card from their psychologist or the government certifing that they are transgender? How Orwellian. So stop with the knee-jerk liberal reactions and listen to other people's objections.
2016-04-10	Jon Swanson Right now there are plenty of trans men out there that used to be women. They are big and muscular. They have beards. They sound, think and act like men. You want them in the bathroom with your little girls?
2016-04-10	Jon Swanson Who is going to do a genital and birth certificate check of every person in a bathroom?
2016-04-10	Well said, Gov Kasich!!!!!!!   There will always be extremist and haters in this world, but it's our responsibility as moderate Republicans to take the reigns back and focus on matters such as building the economy, strengthening our global relationships and keeping America as the greatest nation in the world.
2016-04-10	It is not about hate...it is about trust. It is not that transgender people shouldn't be permitted to use the restroom of choice...but the fact that you cannot determine who is and who is not truly transgender. THe law that spurred this legislation would have permitted a man who says he identifies as a woman to walk into a woman's restroom in a coat and tie. I for one would not stop to ask questions and assume that the man means to harm someone. Again, if you want to be a woman....go all the way. Until you no longer have that male appendage, it is hard to take your word.
2016-04-10	Amon Amarth What I think will happen in the end is we will remove all identities from restrooms and people will just have to go in and use a restroom.
2016-04-10	That's because you're a pathetic, spineless centrist cuck, Kasich. You're funded by George Soros to prevent Trump from earning his rightful spot as GOP nominee. No woman wants to see a man undressing in the bathroom with her, regardless of what the man refers to himself as! It's an absolute disgrace!
2016-04-10	Who's going to be in charge of the strip-searches in order to enact this law?
2016-04-10	Jane Sheppard The law should be: "if you're a biological man and you are caught in the women's restroom, you will be punished." end of story.
2016-04-10	Well said. There's a reason no one's voting for Kasich outside of Ohio.
2016-04-10	this is the point in the war when the Nazis in Germany lose faith in the Fascists in Italy.      Pretty soon, we'll need Japan's Tojo to broker a truce

2016-04-10	Clayton Forrester And Trump is so sensitive!
2016-04-10	It's satire for crying out loud.
2016-04-10	Tom Fitzpatrick....You say that like Trump or his tooters will understand what it means....
2016-04-10	Trump sures has a lot of people scared........live in fear liberals
2016-04-10	What incredible delusion
2016-04-10	Clayton Forrester With you, Clayton.
2016-04-10	Yes, we're so scared. I'll wager Trump shows up for the first debate with Hillary or Bernie, is thoroughly 'trumped,' and then refuses to do any more because he was 'treated poorly.' In other words, he'll refuse to let people see what a moron he is compared to any Democrat.
2016-04-10	If everyone and everything is stupid and dishonest but you, it's likely you are the stupid dishonest one.
2016-04-10	This from a guy who Politico couldn't decide which of one of his numerous lies qualified as the Politifact lie of the year so the just chose Donald Trump's Statements, as in everything he says is a pants on fire lie and his asshole supporters are the only fools who believe him.
2016-04-10	do you really want to talk about who is the biggest liar, son?
2016-04-10	Roy Ellis -hands down trump
2016-04-10	Roy Ellis - It's Trump in a landslide, even back in the 1980's Ed Koch referred to him as a huckster, and CHANGING the subject/person changes NOTHING about Trump. So what's the fucking point of dragging anyone else into this??? Trump is the subject of the article, so why bring someone else up? IT doesn't change the FACT that Trump is a lying fraud.      That's such a bullshit tactic to distract, typical bullshit from a TROLL!!
2016-04-11	Great interview. Shame the 'vocal fry' filter wasn't working.
2016-04-11	Vote for Hillary so she can turn the criminals loose on the rest of us. Don't forget, she will also use your money to bring terrorists across the ocean so they can prey on us too. She will also feed, clothe and house them, with your money, while they are making their bombs and cleaning their Kalashnikovs.      CRUZ / ROHRABACHER 2016   Besides, this guy is the only one more or less honest person left in Congress. Establishment guys hate him very tough !!   Here, Cruz is willing to see him as VP   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Rohrabacher
2016-04-11	Who cares what this bozo thinks? His experience is very limited as a low-end over-hyped press secretary who has "sword fighting" listed as a skill on his linked in page.
2016-04-11	Just saw Tim Miller on CNN! Hes such a dumbass! Sounds just like a dumbass liberal! Tim and Hillary could be kissing cousins! Tim needs to wake up, and realize Jeb Bush, his boss lost the primary early and in a big way! Get over it! The voters have spoken! If you think your going to keep control of Congress without Mr.Trump your a fool! If you dont support Mr.Trump we will all vote democrat on the down ballet! You better wake up Tim, your making an ass out of yourself on national tv. Americans love Trump! He will Make America Great Again! Go! Trump! Go! Trump! 2016!
2016-04-11	Tim Miller. Get off our side. Saw you on tv tonight. Don't like you. Pretending to be a Republican. Not a Republican. Vote for Killlary. And what are you? A ten year old political expert. Ucch.. Spoiled entitled brat.

I can't afford to die." he took the first parachute and jumped.   The 2nd passenger, Hillary Clinton runs screaming, "I'm the smartest politician in the world & the next President of America. She grabbed the second parachute and jumped.   The 3rd passenger, Bernie Sanders says to girl scout "Take the last parachute."   Girl Scout says, "It's ok Bernie, there is a parachute for both of us. The world's smartest politician just took my backpack."      #Women4Bernie #FeelTheBern #AmericaTogether

What happens if Trump isn't the Republican Candidate? There is the biggest question. If Trump fall short and isn't the Republican Nominee there are some very clear mistakes being made by the Clintons and the Democrats.      1: They are blowing every important cash they will need after the primaries to define their Republican opponent.

If Trump is not the nominee Hillary would not need to spend money to win because Trump would do the damage to the GOP free of charge for Hillary, so taken this ad now could stop Trump from being the nominee.      Please, please stop that nonsense Cruz could not beat Hillary even with one brain tied behind her head.   If trump is not the nominee this show is over.   Nobody likes Cruz even the Hispanics, he's against immigration reform just like every republican so why would any Hispanic vote for him?   PLEASE STOP PEDDLING FICTION.

2016-04-11	Olanike Olowere Hillary's negatives are above 55% while Cruz's is around 59% The 4% are basicily within a margin of error. That is exactly where the Real Clear Politics average says the race is right now between Cruz and Cliton.      What you believe is what liberals believe; that Trump has so destroyed any Republican that the election is over. There lies the danger and problem for Clinton.

2016-04-11	Gail - "If" Sanders somehow got the nomination, he would drop like a rock. The GOP isn't aiming their fire at him on purpose. Bread line Bernie and his rape fantasy would get crushed in a general.      Trump vs Sanders would actually be pretty funny, as both would be offering stuff that has a zero percent chance of passing.
2016-04-11	Hillary is a bumbling screw-up. Libya, Russia, Syria, the war in Iraq, Wall St. money,   Arab Spring, Benghazi, the "video", her email server, her witless lies, etc.   When she does something stupid, view it as the norm.
2016-04-11	Lou Kaye   As you know, I am not for Trump. He thinks he can ignore the   rules and bulldog the establishment, conventioneers, and delegates. Sneaking   around signing up rogue delegates is Cruz, working his side of the street. The game   isn't complicated, it's just sleazy. There are no morons here. just two narrow-eyed   operators playing the odds.

2016-04-11	Sorry, Bernie, but demonizing entire industries doesn't work so well in a state that is their global headquarters. Just about every New Yorker has a relative who works in either the Financial or Investment industries. They don't like you talking down to them.
2016-04-11	Bernie is in NY touting that hes from Bklyn, but his old neighborhood is full of Jewish 1 percenters. I know. I grew up in the neighborhood next door.   Its hypocritical and telling at the same time. He grew up around successul people, yet wasnt able to become one himself, and now blames them for all of soceity's problems.   He's seething in envy, and is incapable of leading or accomplishing anything.
2016-04-11	Bud Fox      "Bernie is in NY touting that hes from Bklyn, but his old neighborhood is full of Jewish 1 percenters."      Seems like a great reason to move out and support the 99%, like Sanders did. Or were you pretending that he is a 1%er because he lived near them?

2016-04-11	Phil Gauthier Yes but she also gets more delegates even when she loses the vote in the state. I still remember all the Dems whining about Bush getting elected in 2000 even though he lost the popular vote.

TrumpO only reads stuff that is as important as he is and he has never found anything like that.      TrumpO still hasn't figured out that quality staffing is one of the things we expect from our presidents. Look at the difference between Bush Jr.'s staff selection and Obama's. Does any one think that TrumpO will do better than the Bush, Jr? Our worst president in modern times?

2016-04-11	A good brain like whom? You don't seriously don't think that Trump has a good brain do you? Listen to his third-grade vocabulary. Listen to him NOT answer any question. Listen to him speak for 30 minutes and say exactly nothing. What in the world are you talking about?
2016-04-11	Tim Clair I'm pretty sure he meant that sarcastically.

2016-04-11	They are register Democrats so why would they change both of them are voting for Hillary Clinton.
2016-04-11	I doubt any of them have voted in their lives. That would require standing on line... so, no, Trumpf's don't vote.
2016-04-11	They are registered democrats. Probably changed it online as soon as they realized the mistake. There's a story here.

2016-04-11	Its necessary that Brennan says this publicly. BUT the CIA has been guilty of every possible illegal act over the years. Its plain funny to see Brennan talk about maintaining the CIA's "reputation" with a straight face.
2016-04-11	"the CIA has been guilty of every possible illegal act"      ============================      Specially when a CIA group murdered our dear president Kennedy.
2016-04-11	Agreed the CIA has been guilty of some the the worst crimes the U.S. has ever perpetrated abroad. Why there haven not been more prosecutions of the people responsible is an absolute outrage. It's been positively sickeningly horrendous.      However, the more statements like this out of their mouths, the better.

That's why all Colorado delegates who supported Trump were denied entry to the convention, why a resolution was passed prohibiting votes from Trump, and why the Colorado GOP issued a tweet saying "We did it! #nevertrump".

2016-04-11	Talha Chaudhry Sorry, I don't speak trailer trash!
2016-04-11	This is the game of politics. It's not beanbag. If Trump wants to play politics he has to learn the rules. He can't impose his own rules.
2016-04-11	Maybe the same old rules are the reasons we have OBAMA. Change the f'ing rules so the ruling class is not favored. Change now or it ids the end of the GOP.
2016-04-11	Preston Wilkerson the old rules are republican rules. Obama won twice, you guys didn't. Get over it.
2016-04-11	The problem is Americans are sick and tired of the "Game Of Politics," to us it's not a game, it's our lives.
2016-04-11	Folks if you cant see his 3rd party run coming I dont know what to tell you.
2016-04-11	Democrats can sure hope for one.
2016-04-11	Yes, he is vindictive enough to throw the White House to the Democrats, and the Supreme Court with it, if he does not win the nomination.      He's such a spoiled brat that he thinks he thinks that all other candidates must have 1,237 delegates to win, but he should just be given the nomination even if he does not have 1,237.
2016-04-11	Next to himself, Trump worships the dollar above all -- he won't waste his money on a doomed 3rd party bid.   He'll make a bunch of threats and bluster then disappear back into Trumpland where he is even greater than Kim Johng El.
2016-04-11	Poor Trump, didn't pay attention in class when they were explaining "how delegates are assigned" in Colorado back in August. You think this guy should be president??

2016-04-11	Richard Flay You should have enrolled in Trump University. The first lesson you learn is that Trump is a con man who cannot be trusted.      Of course you could also ask his first two wives ... who he promised in the presence of God ... til death do us part.
2016-04-11	yes
2016-04-11	Reince Priebus, that is NOT okay. Not in the year 2016! I guess it will take a couple Republican rank and file voting boycotts to convince you that we are not going to tolerate candidates selected for us anymore.
2016-04-11	So Repubicans don't like the system of selecting delegates that has been going on for a while...let's see....you feels the rules should be changed to allow your favorite to win without actually winning under the rules that are in place...sounds like you feel you are entitled to something you didn't win!
2016-04-11	By all means, please feel free to stay home on election day.

2016-04-11	Not true at all. His Legal Arizona Workforce Act (LAWA) was held up by the Supreme Court in May 2011. The most important provisions of SB 1070 were held up by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2012. His Taxpayers and Citizens Protection Act in Alabama, which was basically a combination of LAWA and SB 1070, was mostly held up by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and backed up by the Supreme Court rulings mentioned above. His ordinance in Fremont, Nebraska was 75% upheld, including its most important provisions of requiring the use of E-Verify in Fremont. The bills he writes are legally sound. Where they have not been upheld (such as Hazleton, PA and Farmer's Branch, TX) are typically smaller localities which cannot afford to hire legal counsel to match the high priced litigators employed by the ACLU, LULAC, etc. Indeed, the Hazleton ruling in the 3rd Circuit seems to blatantly contradict the May 2011 Supreme Court ruling.

We tried it in the Thirties as the article states and all it did was make the problems fester abroad and worsen until we got violently sucked into them. Trump would do the same leaving behind a worse situation for us and others in the world. Pauper thy neighbor as Trump see's world cooperation was criticized all the way back to Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations.

2016-04-11	Oh please! She said Obama wasn't qualified in '08! This BS "sexism" crap has to stop. If Clinton wants to be President then she has to curb the gender pandering and toughen up. She claims to be tough -- let's see it!
2016-04-11	Her experience has largely been making bad choices on big, important decisions. It's not so much that she doesn't meet the bar for some notion of qualified, but that Bernie meets that bar much better.
2016-04-11	So what? What else does he have? He won't go after her on those "damned emails" and won't attack her record as Secretary of State. Next week Bernie will lose in New York and in a big way. But, at least he can say he lost with class. And Hilliary needs to put on her big girl pantssuit and quit whinning about it. This is a cake walk compared to what she will face after the conventions.
2016-04-11	That's true. On paper, she's experienced. Qualified. Like a good resume      Then you call the references and you realized she screwed up every job she ever had in the last 20 years. and you realize she's not qualified to be a Mayor of a two person town.
2016-04-11	The "references" are the superdelegates who have worked with both Hillary and Bernie. They've overwhelmingly backed Hillary.
2016-04-11	Robert Hewitt.....is that why Hillary has the support by overwhemling numbers, of Senators, and Governors, and Congress people......because they've seen her resume and don't think she's qualified?      Why do you hate your credibility so?

The other 750 bills he sponsored went no where and when he gets asked for details on his bread and butter issues he doesn't have any.
2016-04-11	It is so sweet of her campaign to "worry" about the opposition. Concern-Trolling always entertains.
2016-04-11	She is trying to encourage her supporters to resist being intimidated by the relentless barrage of insults coming from the Sandernistas. Nothing wrong with that. After all, Sanders frequently says he is going to win the nomination (he isn't). But I would do the same thing in his shoes.
2016-04-11	Lanthrop Whitney I hear... anxiety. Go figure. Hehehehehehe.
2016-04-11	What Bernie actually KNOWS about anything you could stuff in a thimble and still have room to breed fleas.....He literally could not answer hard questions at the editorial board meeting about HOW he would enact his policies..Outisde of telling the Treasury Department to shut down Wall Street banks, whic is acutally AGAINST THE LAW, HE LOOKED LIKE AN IGNORANT OLD FART WAY OUT OF HIS LEAGUE.. Voted against the Brady Bill three times (notice he never mentions that?), voted aginst liability for gun makers........Why don't you trolls actually visit HIS record..He is scamming the stupid.....   One last thing--Grandpa Walton dealing with North Korea will send sane people out to build bomb shelters.....
2016-04-11	She's lost 8 out of the last 9, but Sanders is the one with growing anxiety, LOL.
2016-04-11	She was so far in the lead she could afford to lose 8 of 9 and STILL be 2.5 mill votes ahead and ready to lower the boom coming East...8 more days...tick..tock....
2016-04-11	It's about delegates. You can have the loony caucuses in the hinterland. Clinton will take Manhattan. You know, I actually like Bernie a lot; it's his supporters I have trouble with.
2016-04-11	Yet, he is still down in pledged delegates and votes counted. Winning the 8 out the last 9 is meaningless when one isn’t gaining in both categories.
2016-04-11	Bernie can't do 4th grade math and Hillary isn't sure how email works. I'm really torn between these Genius level superstars! LOL times a Million.
2016-04-11	Then what does it say about the GOP that either could beat any conservative?
2016-04-11	Mark Keeler yes, that is why this election is shaping up to be the saddest in memory. Assuming Hillary wins, I know that there is no hope at all for the poor in this nation and we will take another large step towards the increasingly inevitable violent end.
2016-04-11	Mark Keeler Voters are dumb? Trump can do math.
2016-04-11	Hillary is so far ahead that she is no longer even talking about Sanders. She isn't even showing up in states before primaries because she has won so many states in a row now.      If she was worried that she would lose she would be doing press conferences every day, desperately doing photo ops in upcoming primary states, and trying to find wedge issuse to drive between her and Sanders.      She hasn't been doing any of that. She's been sitting on a beach in Florida for the last 3 months because she knows she is so far ahead that Sanders can't win.      /endsarcasm
2016-04-11	You need to work on thos sarcasm skills. However, you provide a good example of why sarcasm is known as the lowest form of wit.
2016-04-11	When a candidate has the nomination in the bag, they don't sit home, they travel the country and shore up for the general election, just like she's doing. Enough with the "states in a row" "argument." If they held the southern state primaries now, she'd win them again and people would say she has "momentum". It's just a calendar.
2016-04-11	You have made valid points before, this isn't of them. Even after all those states, she is still very comfortably ahead
2016-04-11	Anxiety? She best have some anxiety- if she remains silent on the voter suppression tricks she will see million writing Bernie's name in- in the general election.

2016-04-11	Sanders doesn't think that people should be sued when they have done nothing wrong, thinks that assault weapons should be banned, and supports the violence against women act.      Not sure why these things are hard to understand.
2016-04-11	How about his vote against the Brady bill, that's pretty hard to understand.
2016-04-11	Susan Burke      That is the bill that allowed people to sue companies for no reasons.

So is the clause in the Brady bill that would have allowed victems to sue gun companies that did nothing wrong.

2016-04-11	The Young Turks shared Secular Talk Radio - The Kyle Kulinski Show's video.      Kyle calls Hillary out on her latest attack on Bernie --   Hillary Invokes The Sandy Hook Mass Shooting To Attack Bernie   https://www.facebook.com/SecularTalk/videos/974313625971617/      More breaking News -- A Clinton Superdelegate Just Admitted That Hillary Lied About Bernie and Guns (VIDEO) http://usuncut.com/politics/clinton-superdelegate-lie/
2016-04-11	Jesse Cooday And what did "Kyle" say when President Obama invoked Sandy Hook to attack the Do-Nothing Republican NRA asswipes? Or does "Kyle" only complain about extremist right wing votes/policies by Republicans -- but socialist gun nuts are okay with him?      Fact: Sanders caved to the gun lobby in Vermont. That shows that if "Bernie" was in the White House, he'd cave to the Military-Industrial Complex. You and "Kyle" are never-ending suckers!
2016-04-11	Hillary is absolutely correct here. Bernie votes and talks like he's in the gun lobbies pockets.
2016-04-11	Hillary doesn't support the violence against women act?      She doesn't support assault weapons bans?      She supports frivolus lawsuits?
2016-04-11	Except Hillary is the one taking money from gun lobbies, but nice try. Oh and the fact check on Vermont supplying guns is completely false, but that doesn't seem to stop her from slandering and mud slinging. I am so tired of her lies and the people defending them.
2016-04-11	Tim Hoefling are you saying there aren't laws that says its against the law to attck women??
2016-04-11	And the facts show that less than 1% of guns used in crimes in New York ove the past like 20 years have come from Vermont, so... (per capita..... talk about misleading statistics)      My position on gun control is very similar to Sanders'. Yes, we do need more regulation. Allowing people to sue gun sellers or manufactorers any time a gun is used in a crime is absurd (as the original bill that he didn't sign allowed). Allowing to sue based on specific facts, like manufacturers intentionally making it easy for their guns to get onto the black market, etc., yeah, that make sense.
2016-04-11	Exactly.      Clinton and her supporters are desperate. They are taking these votes out of context to trick gullible people into thinking that Sanders is some sort of gun nut.
2016-04-11	Tim Hoefling Agree that Clinton is making a mountain out of a molehill on the gun issue, disagree that "Clinton and her supporters are desperate." Math is not inspiring, but it is what it is. Today's polls provide further evidence.
2016-04-11	Tim Hoefling   Democracy requires an intelligent and educated public, which is why the right has dumbed down education, both in school and in public discourse and journalism. Rather than fighting that trend HRC, being of the rightwing persuasion, uses it to the max.
2016-04-11	Yes, I'll grant that single issue where Hillary is more progressive than Bernie.      Cling to it.      ...Well, at least for the moment. Hillary on guns in 08:   http://www.washingtontimes.com/.../clinton-gun-control.../
2016-04-11	Alex Meyer You can vote for whoever you like. I root for Bernie. Americans have had a bad habit of doing a little bit of regime change and telling foreigners how to live. Which has turned into a unmitigated disaster for the Middle East and consequently, Europe. So I have a vested interest in promoting a peace and dialogue oriented candidate like Bernie in the White House. Furthermore I think it's about time the US joins the rest of the civilized world on so many issues.
2016-04-11	Alex Meyer Why don't you try to keep out of other countries leaderships then? Supporting a candidate that turned Lybia into a failed state, that toppled Central American democracies while the international community was against the coup, supports overtrowing Assad, but does not have any plan for stabilizing after that. Stop your warmongering and imperialist attitude and maybe all the other nations might feel more relaxe about whoever the Americans choose to be commander in chief of the only nation that use WMD's in a war and refuses to apologize for it.
2016-04-11	FYI, the Washington Times is not a credible newspaper, it's run by the Moonies. Next time try the Washington Post.
2016-04-11	Who made Carson the expert on this stuff anyway? Isn't this his first foray into politics and now he's handing out advise like an old hand. If you want real confusion change rules in mid race, future rules changes are taken up at the convention this Summer. Its not like the current rules weren't around for a while and everyone running should have taken the trouble to know them. This is what happens when you have instant experts giving opinions, ignorance is bliss as they say.
2016-04-11	I might have been inclined to agree that the process should be as democratic as possible, but current events suggest that the current process does a good job of showing what candidates actually pay attention to rules and hiring competent staff.
2016-04-11	I agree with Carson...DIRTY POLITICS in COLADO.
2016-04-11	Where is "COLADO?" Sounds like a place dreamed up by an addict.
2016-04-11	Did you notice that no one complained to anything prior to them having a problem. If they thought their was a real problem they certainly had years to speak out but their was silence, if they want to change the system they should try after the selection process is over and not try to change it to help themselves.
2016-04-11	Did anyone tell Carson, Cruz or Trump that the popular vote does not select the president it is the electoral college.
2016-04-11	They plan to depose Hillary about the time of the Democratic convention!   SECOND FEDERAL COURT GRANTS DISCOVERY IN CLINTON EMAIL CASE   http://www.judicialwatch.org
2016-04-11	You realize that discovery is not necessarily a deposition. They could serve requests for production, interrogatories, requests for admissions.

2016-04-11	Guess Rubio can't come back either when he said ...."Trump is a fraud and a con man...blah blah blah"...

2016-04-11	Seems like the same results from an earlier poll. If they hold (I'm sure they will tighten for Clinton/Sanders), that will be the end of the Sanders campaign.      Anything over a 10 point win for Clinton and Sanders should shut it down. I'm thinking closer to an 8 pont Clinton win. Sanders will still keep going, but only to keep fundraising.
2016-04-11	Anything less than about a fifteen point win by Sanders will not be on track to catch up.
2016-04-11	Sterling Smith That's right; they've said for weeks now that he has to win big states BIG - so, here we are - and that hasn't changed. If Sanders doesn't win Big - he's not catching up enough.   I like Bernie - but socialism hasn't fully sold itself in the US yet.   If they could elect several openly socialist governors, senators, etc., I could start to think they have a real chance. Where are they, Bernie?
2016-04-11	Why in the world should Sanders shut anything down?      He's got a message, he's got money, and he's got absolutely no reason to bow out in favor of Hillary. The same proportional allocation system that won't let him catch up also won't knock him out even if Hillary wins NY by 15 points.

Much better to focus on the positive, glass half full - than negative, sour, glass half empty 'but I! didn't win' stuff. If the movement is real, and not just a one-man Bernie cult - it should endure; prove it - back and help elect other candidates.
2016-04-11	This would be Trump's first result over 50% - if it holds.      If I'm Cruz or Kasich I'd be hoping that many Trump supporters in polls like this didn't register as Republicans by the deadline.

2016-04-11	ted says drudge champions trump...as politico champions ted
2016-04-11	So Drudge is doing to the Cruzifix what the entire RNC is doing to Trump? And he's crying about it like a little boy who just had his lunch money stolen?..."anti-Christian" attacks...on Drudge?      These would be Elmer Gantry's are so used to crying "war on religion" at every ridiculous opportunity (a device now being used to install bigotry-allowed laws throughout the NeoConfederacy), that now they are using the baseless charge against their fellow Republicans. All Glory Goes to God !
2016-04-11	No one has whined more than Trump. Worse than John McEnroe for throwing fits.
2016-04-11	Cindy Kelley Bogan I think it is a tie between Cruz and Trump.
2016-04-11	Cruz is the worst thing that ever happened to Christianity. We were always taught not to lie and he is a pathelogical liar and has hired crooked campaign people to do dirty tricks. Not what I learned in Sunday School. Check this out! (All Trump’s positions discussed have been cast in concrete since day one and everyone, including Cruz, knew them.)   https://youtu.be/zwIHJhtTSLg   and then https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMvuuywiQcw   and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7gZ3_I7lW4   Now is that Christian?
2016-04-11	Too cute. Does he tell them at the same time that he doesn't yet know if he'll support them or other down- ballot Democrats. What a comedian.

2016-04-11	Anyone can call themselves a Democrat but the only candidate that stands for the values of Democrats is Sanders. The former Goldwater Girl is a DINO out of convenience only. She is hawkish for war and an abhorant recorord on the environment. She backs trade deals that favor her donor class 1 %ers and leaves the middle class without.      Some Democrat.
2016-04-11	Tim Wilson you're a typical hater. Hillary Clinton has been working hard for women and working people and progressive issues her entire adult life. The bullshit you and others keep spouting is so old.
2016-04-11	The reason most Super Delegates have already sided with Clinton is because of the money funneled to them through the Hillary Victory Fund. They are afraid of losing that financial support during election cycles. If Bernie were to prove that he could fund "progressive" Democrats with his amazing fund raising machine, that could help sway some delegates. (Are you listening Bernie?)
2016-04-11	Steve Woods....why shouldn't they support the candidate that supports them. Bernie just says 'we'll see'
2016-04-11	Cheryl Onstad By support, you mean financial? That's the way it works now.   http://www.alternet.org/.../how-scotus-decision-best...
2016-04-11	Its because Hillary is a real democrat that has been raising money and giving her time for other democrats for decades. Even when she is not running for anything. Bernie has not given a dime of the millions he has raised, or any of his time. Wait a minute, he has signed a letter so others can donate per his request. Wonder how long it took him to sign that letter.
2016-04-11	So this is an article about delegates Bernie has already convinced. All 31 of them.

2016-04-11	Jesse Cooday yeah, because well all like to not have heat in the wintertime. Where do you think natural gas comes from? you HATE the poor as you would cause heating and cooking costs to skyrocket.
2016-04-11	Jesse Cooday Here is an issue we women care about:Equality and not some old fart telling us we are NOT qualified..Who can handle North Korea...NOT BERNIE....Who can handle China....NOT BERNIE.....   The only women I know for Bern are not old enough to sit across from any guy who tells them what Bernie said to Hillary....We spent decades fighting old farts like him.....Hell will freeze before I vote for that.Tell your ladies to go talk to their Grandmothers about who Bernie really is....
2016-04-11	What a hypocrite. So much for his platform of "priciples".
2016-04-11	Have you even read the article?
2016-04-11	What is lacking in his principles?
2016-04-11	Tim Wilson what's lacking about his principles you ask? LOL   We know by now when Bernie votes for something, there is a 50% chance he and his voters will say- he really did not vote in the way he did intended to.      Bernie voted YES to Clinton's Crime Bill --- but now you are saying he did not   Bernie voted YES to WARS (multiple ones) --- but now you are saying he did not   Bernie voted NO to Gun control Bill --- but now you are saying he did not   Bernie voted NO to immigration Bill --- but now you are saying he did not   Bernie voted YES to Clinton Crime Bill --- but now you are saying he did not   Bernie said genocidal Castro and other Latin American dictators were" impressive because they gave free college and healthcare" --- but now you are saying he did not
2016-04-11	Why should super delegates support Bernie Sanders when he hasn't ever supported the Democrates?
2016-04-11	Sure he has. He raises money for the DNC all the time.
2016-04-11	Steve Woods but he gives no money
2016-04-11	Steve Woods you mean that whole one thousand dollars?
2016-04-11	I really can't see why he'd give up his guarantee of the second-most powerful position in the country for a risky shot at the White House that he could only claim by stepping over the dead bodies of Trump and Cruz.      What in the world would *that* nomination be worth?
2016-04-11	No one is misreading Paul Ryan. No one is misreading because Paul Ryan is doing this himself sending out mixed messages. It leaves the doors open
2016-04-11	Second most powerful?I thought the VP was second in line?
2016-04-11	The way he would get the nomination would be pretty scetchy but it's a much better job than hearding cats in the House. 20% of his caucus is a crisis waiting to happen. There is also all the polices that he has spewed for the last decade that he at some point has to act on; none of them are serious but they are a big piece of what got him the job.
2016-04-11	Well Ryan, then quit uttering and don't put out anymore "utterance" ads.

2016-04-11	Thanks to Kasich, Cruz got knocked off the Mich delegates to the rules committee. Cruz yes is working hard in the smoke filled rooms to steal delegates, but in the long run who knows.
2016-04-11	All he has to do is issue a "Shermanesque" statement - "If nominated, I will not run. If elected, I will not serve"
2016-04-11	Ill say it again: regardless of what you think of his politics, Ryan has a bright political future ahead and certainly will be running in the future. Why on earth would he step in this s--t puddle now and be forever stained?

2016-04-11	Why is Trump winning the American voters over after 30 years of D.C. security and economic disasters ?   Common sense: Fair trade deals, enhanced border security, safety and increased military self-defense and vet support.   http://www.usatoday.com/.../donald-trump.../82899566/   He means it when he says, "The people of the United States expect their president to make tough decisions that could require the use of enhanced interrogation and I will not disappoint them. I will do whatever it takes to protect and defend this nation and its people."   https://www.washingtonpost.com/.../border-patrol-agents.../   "The union representing 16,500 Border Patrol agents has endorsed businessman Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination."
2016-04-11	14,400,000 Americans belong to Unions. 16,500 support Trump - big deal.
2016-04-11	Trump isn't 'winning the American voters over'; he is supported by a small segment of Americans, especially the uneducated, ill-informed, and/or rabidly bigoted, many of whom can't even be called 'voters' because they never voted before. Even most of his family isn't registered to vote in the primary.      'Common sense' in complex matters you lack even a rudimentary understanding of is practically useless; a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and total ignorance infected by hubris is even worse. He has repeatedly displayed his mind-boggling cluelessness in economics, foreign affairs, military policy... and everything else except perhaps eminent domain, something that has been useful to him in his career as a sleazy real estate developer.      Donald Trump is a deranged narcissist who isn't even qualified to be elected head clown at a failing circus. Suggesting that he 'means what he says' is hilarious—a pathological liar, he takes positions all over the map before walking them back.
2016-04-11	How easily people can be played. Just look at Greg Smith's post.
2016-04-11	Who is he to be talking about honesty?
2016-04-11	He should be doing better in New York state after all it still is a democrat state isn't it? Speaking of which did anyone else hear Trump on fox and friends this morning where he all but calls himself a democrat? Listen at around the 3:25 mark. To funny LMAO!!      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnx2i0Dz_7Y
2016-04-11	Hopefully they won't cancel the election and just hand the delegates to Cruz like they did in Colorado or give the delegates to Cruz even though Trump won like in Louisiana. I thought our votes counted!!
2016-04-11	Your votes don't count when they're cast for full-blooded retards
2016-04-11	Uglyspider Jones No worries. No one voted for you.
2016-04-11	Isn't it rich that YOUR party, the one that rails against government, and which champions state rights, set up these rules. And no, it isn't the establishment as Trump claims... These are rank and file members, Republican activists who decided on the system beforehand. It just so happens that Trump was too incompetent to secure delegate candidates that were in his favor.      The establishment hates Cruz, yet he was able to do the hard work of securing delegates. But of course Trump only knows to blame others when he fails.      And before you and his followers whine, don’t forget he has only won an...See More

2016-04-11	When party activists can choose delegates without any input from the voters, and those activists are establishment supporters, there is nothing that will persuade those activists to pick any delegates who support an insurgent candidate.

2016-04-11	It's a party primary which it means its the PARTIES rules. It has nothing to do with democracy and a "majority".      Hopefully, some day soon people will decide if you want to be part of a process you may want to undertsand what the process actually is.      Trump CHOSE to run as a Republican and CHOSE to accept those rules. If you don't want to play by those rules then stop running as Republican. Whining that the rules don't benefit you is kind of ridicolous.

2016-04-11	They fo have to earn the support of voter's in the general election. The parties are private organizations and permitted to choose their nominees however they wish. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that the concept of primaries even came about. For most of US history, party nominees were chosen by delegates at conventions and voters were not involved until the general election.
2016-04-11	I loved Colordo, but since the state people fraudulently chose a fraudulent, idot and a liar to be their representative, I now think differently.

2016-04-12	Bill O'Reilly is as ignorant as they come. I have heard Donald Trump make the claim before that 59% of African American youths are unemployed but have never presented any evidence to back up his claim, this man is known to create his own numbers to serve his own self interest, he needs to be called out for this.   Last year the Labour Statistics board presented these numbers The youth labor force participation rate was highest for whites, at 62.3 percent in July 2015. The rate was 56.4 percent for blacks, 44.6 percent for Asians, and 56.2 percent for Hispanics. The rate for blacks rose by 3.5 percentage points from the previous July, while the rates for whites, Asians, and Hispanics showed little or no change.      http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/youth.pdf      Any minority or anyone who votes for Donald Trump is a vote against their own self interest unless you are the KKK, Bigot,Sexist, Teabagger, or works at Fox news but not named Megyn Kelly.
2016-04-12	...and many white men are bigoted, overfed, overindulged rightwing extremists. Guess that covers everyone...
2016-04-12	Tony Prescott I'm not trying to taking any sides, not really a fan of any candidate, but just to clarify the statistics you quote above represent the "labor force participation rate". This represents the percentage of the total capable youth population that is actively seeking employment. The claim of 59% is likely being derived from the number of employed youths as a percentage of the total youth population in each demographic, however that number would be 55.3%, not 59%.

2016-04-12	I am very sure this is the "democracy" that Politico is looking for. People are cheating Trump in broad daylight and the media is playing it as normal?      How on earth would all 34 delegates in colorado just go to Ted Cruz without a single vote? Yet this is celebrated by the media. Let's now go to the states of luisiana and south Carolina that Trump won handily. They are bringing in funny stuffs and awarding to Ted cruz delegates he didn't win with the voters. What is the meaning of this? Is this the meaning of ground game? Why didn't Ted Cruz "famed" ground game produce more voters? Why?      Vot...See More
2016-04-12	How is it cheating if the rules are the same for all RNC candidates? If Drumpf cannot figure out those rules, how is he going to be smart enough to make all those sneaky deals he brags about making?
2016-04-12	Sharon Brucks I know you wouldn't be saying this if the advantage were Trump's. You hate him I concede that to you, but to say he's not being cheated is the height of hypocrisy. Why is it so difficult for anti-Trump's people to win more voters? Why? Why go through the backdoor?      If he is not good, make your case to the voters and win him. These "games" are just funny..
2016-04-12	There were votes in Colorado. The votes took place in convention meetings. Trump lost those votes.
2016-04-12	Bernie Sanders and his Bernie Bro supporters act like Facists. THEY ARE THE ONLY PURE PROGRESSIVES EVERYONE ELSE IS TAINTED. They sound like Nazi's.      It's why Hillary is mopping the floor with Bernie in New York.
2016-04-12	I don't even get what a Progressive is....is it a super liberal? Like an over top, extreme liberal? Sanders makes it look like it means "unrealistic" or beyond reality or almost religious cult.

They even say they will vote for Trump or Cruz in the general election if Bernie loses (he lost on Super Tuesday).

2016-04-12	And it is also Republicans who want to throw as much sand as possible into Hillary's wheels so that she will lose momentum.      I don't understand why "Progressives" would want to stop a young Latino, a successful Mayor of a major American city, and a proven Democrat from becoming the VP in a Democratic campaign that is doing its level best to be welcoming, big-tent and diverse.      If Hillary caves and names Bernie as her VP, a Liberal Socialist from Vermont who will be absolutely no help in swing states like Ohio and North Carolina and Colorado and Virginia and Nevada, all of which would swing easily to Hillary with Castro aboard, I will be very disappointed.      Anyway I think stupid Bernie done Bernt all his bridges last week, by calling Hillary a sellout, a shill, and an unqualified woman with poor judgment.      i hope Hillary makes him PAY big-time for that.

Struggling people don't need pipe-dreams of 'revolution' - they need things now - like a more favorable Supreme Court - that would be lost for DECADES with a losing 'revolutionary' campaign.
2016-04-12	I don't think Sanders would lose the General Election but that is besides the point. Clinton can and will choose the vice president but that does not mean that people are going to be happy with simply anyone regardless of their politics and record.
2016-04-12	The nominee does not have a free hand in choosing the VP, never has. It is   negotiated and brokered. See: Kennedy and LBJ

Bernard has said and done things that he said he'd never do and had never done. He has not remained true to his principles. Where are your tax returns Bernard? Just saying, where's the transparency?
2016-04-12	I really don't understand this call for tax returns. He's the least wealthy candidate on either side, even when the GOP had 15 candidates going, and he released 2014, which includes a decently large amount of debt, kinda like most Americans. What do you expect to find there, Macy's credit card?

2016-04-12	Sold his soul? No, he is merely stating the truth.      "sold his soul"...... Do you mean like, being the policy face for the financial industry interests of this country the way Hillary is constantly changing everything about her to fit politics of today because she really has no scruples at all and only cares about her own power?
2016-04-12	Bernie needs to get his wife to release those top secret tax returns. What is he hiding?
2016-04-12	release wall street transcripts
2016-04-12	Charles Hensley Yeah the Goldman Sachs transcripts seem much more pertinent than the tax returns from the least wealthy candidate to run this year. I'm honestly at a complete loss about what people expect to find in his tax returns, but it's quite obvious what we could find in those transcripts.
2016-04-12	What do you expect to find in Bernie Sander's financial statements?
2016-04-12	Happy he lives in England. We do not need one more socialist with crazy ideas where everything is free, free tuition, free healthcare, etc. Why bother interviewing this idiot? Why would anyone care what he thinks? CNN has hit the bottom once again.
2016-04-12	well, free healthcare works over there, and in canada, and in denmark, and in sweden, and and and..... Many places university is free. I am still looking for the anarchy.... nope not seeing it..... still looking for the loss of freedom.....nope not seeing it.... still looking for failed states.....      hmmmm... data do not appear to be on your side.
2016-04-12	Bryan Davis I'm currently going to grad school in Canada, where tuition for residents is roughyl $2k per semester. What's crazy about that? Sure it's mostly funded by taxes, but poor people actually have the opportunity to go if they get the grades and choose to.

2016-04-12	The difference is Rand Paul understood that this is how the Party works. If you don't like the way it's done, don't be a member of the GOP or start another party.

2016-04-12	Rigged does not mean illegal. It doesn't imply shadyness. It means arranged or built      Rigged:      Assemble and adjust (the equipment of a sailboat, aircraft, etc.) to make it ready for operation.   "most sails are kept ready rigged"   Set up (equipment or a device or structure), typically hastily or in makeshift fashion.   "he had rigged up a sort of tent"      Both sides rig their elections to keep outsiders out. Dems worse than most Rep states.
2016-04-12	I'm fine with his interpretation. It is biased, always has been, and always will be. Trump stormed the GOP, should have known how to play the game, and now complains because they didn't roll out the welcome mat. He is trying to take their party, he should have read some history
2016-04-12	I think the Republicans are worse than the Dems..........both are making sure one candidate doesn't win, but the Republicans are right out there about it! Like the tweet about We did it No Trump..........then they took it down right away. This was in Colorado where no one voted, but Cruz got all the delegates.
2016-04-12	Diane Daneker In that state, yes it's worse for Reps. But overall, the Dems are the most corrupt.
2016-04-12	This process is no different than what happens in business organizations, entrenched management is slow to acknowledge new upstarts and that provides a certain continuity and risk averse behavior to the organization. Political parties are no different in that sense nor is our Electoral College system in Presidential elections. It doesn't mean things don't change, but those changes have to be around long enough not to be seem as a whim or a flight of fancy and based in reality. Trump is not based in reality by a long shot.
2016-04-12	Trump and Sanders, regardless of what you think of them, have exposed the system for what it is...a lie. Your vote, your interest, even your participation means nothing, and never did. A small pool of pre approved acceptable candidates were presented, and you were hoodwinked into believing you chose them, and chose rhe ultimate winner. It was, and is, a lie.
2016-04-12	Trumps 37% of the republican party, Only in the delusioned mind is 37% a majority

2016-04-12	Hank Marcus I dont support Trump, but it doesnt have to be a majority, only a plurality. 37% is a sight more than anyone else. Its irrelevant though, the people have never had a choice, just pre approved candidates served up by those with a vested interest in staying in power. Its like Thomas Jefferson said....there needs to be a revolution every generation.

2016-04-12	Henri Picker   There is not a single analyst who can name a state that Romney lost that Cruz can win.   Kasich beats her in several of them, as does Trump. This is not my opinion; it is a   standard analysis.
2016-04-12	The problem with Kasich is that he's a moderate in a party that has become conservative. It is not the party Kasich is longing for when moderate Republicans were the norm and conservatives the wingnuts on the right. What happened is Republicans have turned away from the future of an improving society and back to one where they the few get the benefits in spite of the fact that it doesn't work for most, if it ever did. So they sit in their relatively comfortable hovels and vote down the future for all. Kasich has a lot of minds to change.
2016-04-12	Actually, he just appears moderate. His policy positions and what he's done as Governor of Ohio aren't too far removed from Cruz and Trump. Kasich is just quieter and sneakier.
2016-04-12	Brian Crowder What he's saying is more moderate and since this is not their year its all moot.
2016-04-12	Brian Crowder You are absolutely correct. Governor Kasich is a neocon. Has been from the very beginning. He is a fake conservative. But this says so much about the GOP and what it is all about. The party has moved so far right that Governor Kasch seems like a moderate. But he is not

2016-04-12	Prem Singh You make no sense, kid.
2016-04-12	Maybe Clinton should flip some of his SD and see how that goes over in Sander's camp?
2016-04-12	Considering she has over 250 to his 38. I'm not sure that is possible. Plus dont forgot that most of these SD's put their vote for clinton 8 months ago before the Sanders campaign was even thought to be a viable option for the demacratic party. She has to worry about losing SD's because that's the only way it can go for her. And with the comments of her campaign I think they are starting to worry that he can swing their pledge to Sanders. Why else would you take this line of attack.

Sorry Bernie Bros, Hillary's delegate lead will begin to accelerate from here on out.      It will end up being a slam dunk win for the first woman to ever be the Presidential nominee of a major political party
2016-04-12	yep
2016-04-12	Peter Jones Yes, among "likely Democratic voters" in New York (home to Wall Street) Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders 55% to 41% — but that doesn't include Independents. The Democrat's party rules keep millions of Independents out of the New York primary. Democrats, who oppose strict "Jim Crow" voting laws in the South, don't want Independents in the North and elsewhere to vote. Why is that? I always thought the Democrats believed that EVERYONE should have a right to vote...unless if you want to vote for someone that is not acceptable to the Democratic Party machine.
2016-04-12	Bud Meyers This has nothing to do with voting rights. It's about a political party choosing its nominee. The party can do that in any fashion it wants, and if in some states, the party decides that you must declare yourself a member of that party through registration or voting, then that is what you must to do participate in the decisionmaking. That does not at all infringe on anyone's right to vote.

2016-04-12	This is completely wrong in terms of delegates for the Dems. Missouri has 71 pledged delegates, not 68. It will likely be 36-35 for Sanders. And leave the Superdelegates out of it. They don't pledge until the convention. Stop being biased.
2016-04-12	You mean 36-35 for Clinton, seeing as how she won the state. Not that it really matters. I'd hope that next Tuesday would put this to bed, but it's not like people are going to learn math between now and then.
2016-04-12	You keep repeating that MO has 71 delegates but the remianing delegates has not been awared. Do you have any sources that Sanders will " likely" win the remaining delegates? Say, he does; he still loses.
2016-04-12	Michael Eisenberg, No, I mean 36-35 for Bernie. He has more delegates to the state/district conventions.

2016-04-12	Mr. Trump was a New York Democrat until last year.      He has donated a lot more money to the Democratic Party (Jeb Bush said it).      He then realized that racism is not welcome on the Liberal side and quickly switched parties.
2016-04-12	If he was a racist and a democrat for all those years, why didn't the democrats out him then? Because they we're getting in his pocket? hahahaha what a bunch of hypocrites.
2016-04-12	It's not 1993 anymore.
2016-04-12	Tell that to the families Bill Clinton's Welfare Reform Act affected. Or his masked racism that put more minorities away. The impacts are still relevant.
2016-04-12	This is BS, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are not alike. Bill lifts people up, respects every ethnicity and religion, while Donald Trump is the complete opposite. He's made a careeer out of insulting everyone and viciously attacking women. Trump is irrationally impulsive, as his constant meaningless but mean spirited Tweets show.      Bill believes that we can make America work for everyone, because we are special and the greatest country in the world. While Trump no longer thinks and does not believe we are great, that is why he makes all his products in China, cuts corners to exploit the system and constantly pays the lowest taxes possible, at the detriment of struggling and hardworking Americans.
2016-04-12	Brain-washed much?

2016-04-12	Truth? The Clinton's are pathetic, unabashed hypocrites.
2016-04-12	Must have been the Judicial Watch folks living at the Clinton Library trying to dig up dirt on the Clinton's. I heard they moved right in when Hillary entered the race.

2016-04-12	Richard Flay This attack is more than 5 years old, you had to look long and hard to find something bad to say about Kasich.Gov. Kasich met with Officer [Robert] Barrett and apologized and that apology was graciously accepted," Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said in a statement to FoxNews.com. It was a friendly meeting during which the governor reiterated his support for law enforcement officers and for the dangerous and important work they do." http://www.foxnews.com/.../kasich-earns-ire-public-safety...

2016-04-12	Instead of "Hail to the Chief" they should have played "I'm a Loser".
2016-04-12	Well...as an "establishment" candidate, he would say that. Cruz is actually very well qualified.
2016-04-12	Barry Goldwater said in 1994 that ,and I am parphrasing that he was afraid that the preachers were going to take over the GOP. For governing and politics to work you need compromise. The problem with these religious people is that they believe they are being directed by GOD so they will not compromise. I know. I have tried to work with them. Funny. Senator Goldwater saw the writing on the wall with people like Cruz years ago.
2016-04-12	Though primary voters have largely dismissed candidates with long political resumes, they're also hungry for a candidate who can steer the nation's foreign policy and national security in a turbulent time. John Kasich is a true Washington Outsider in the sense that he has never been beholden to either the republicans or democrats his entire career, but instead speaks for the American people. John is John and what you see is what you get. Someone who can work with all parties to move our country forward. Someone that does not have to change his message to run in the general election. Someone selected as the best candidate by foreign policy experts to protect our nation. Someone who has balanced the budget. The only one that can beat Hillary in the general election.

2016-04-12	Super delegates do not vote until the convention. Why do they reflect on the total delegate count as of now?
2016-04-12	Because the ones counted have stated support for a candidate. As representatives of the Democratic Party, they did and should support the Democratic candidate AND Hillary is leading with more than 2 million popular votes.      They will not switch to Sanders unless he get the required number of regular delegates and that is not going to happen.
2016-04-12	Patty Nolte , I understand the point you are trying to make, but the question is not for a regular reader. It is a bit more for the reporting news outlet. Superdelegates have not voted and "stating" support is not an official vote, it's speculation. Have a great day.
2016-04-12	Patty Nolte How can you count votes that haven't been cast yet?
2016-04-12	Politico, why not mention the fact that the party and Hill's camp KNEW about this for 5 WEEKS and they're just releasing this information now?
2016-04-12	I'm not sure if Hillary's camp knew that Bernie's camp didn't know. Do you know that for a fact?
2016-04-12	Mark Hendricks It's on the Denver Post's article. Pretty damning.
2016-04-12	Mark Hendricks Full Quote: "The error — first uncovered by The Denver Post — was shared with rival Hillary Clinton's campaign by party officials but kept from Sanders until the Post told his staff Monday night."
2016-04-12	The same almost certainly occurred in Wyoming. He was about to win two counties until a box full of Hillary votes came in.
2016-04-12	The super-absentee ballots... like in Arizona and maybe like in NY...
2016-04-12	Wyoming Dems are super angry... see their FB page, this is the trick HRC uses, "surrogates" who no-show at the state convention.
2016-04-12	They should have told both camps. That just "looks" shady.
2016-04-12	It is shady.
2016-04-12	Lou Kaye Yes but these comments are for an article about shady behavior in Colorado specifically
2016-04-12	Lou Kaye Show me a picture on Twitter of a room full of people on Hillary's side where he benefitted from a miscount. You can see he has the people. It's hard to fake human bodies standing up for you in a room, maybe that's why Hillary didn't have enough delegates to keep Nevada and Missouri.

2016-04-12	Cheryl Onstad No, Obama is not fixing Bush's mess, he has amplified it. The national debt was $10.6 trillion when Obama came in and he has run it up to over $19 trillion now, mostly on entitlement programs. How's that Iran deal going for you? It was supposed to make us safer but anyone short of a fool's intelligence knows you can't make friends with a country that continues to chant "death to America". $150 billion dollars in the hole on that one and Iran continues to launch medium test range missiles and violate Obama's own agreement.
2016-04-12	Voting for someone just because of their gender or race is wrong. Voting a woman for President just because she is a woman...and it would be historic...and it is past time is insulting to all intelligent women. You vote for the PERSON who is best suited for the job. The person who is proven trustworthy. The person whom our military would gladly follow. The person who other nations will respect. If this was a roundabout way for him to endorse Clinton...it is insulting...as is much that he says.

2016-04-12	Enough Americans have worked for a woman to see whether having a female President actually makes a difference or not. According to feminists since women are equal to men - it wouldn't matter, right? Frankly, no one should consider voting for someone based on being the spouse of an ex-President.      I would gladly vote for a woman who's not riding the coattails of her ex-politician husband. A woman President will happen one day, but it's nothing to push for. The response to a candidate should be organic and not some phony guilt-laden politically correct B.S.      The lives of 300 million Americans isn't about the selfish indulges of an immoral, vile, greedy, power hungry, warmongering, despicable elderly baby boomer.

I understand everyone is offering a product, and here we are commenting and reading it, but news this is not.

2016-04-12	I am afraid they might be. Not all of us though. I can't believe that it will be the black vote to put this person in the White House.
2016-04-12	I'd argue that people who believe that a candidate for president who says he'll get passed this Congress a single payer system, free college and the dismantling of all the major banks are the gullible ones.
2016-04-12	Michael EisenbergThe alternative is trying nothing, while starting some new wars?
2016-04-12	As Luis Miller asserts, “in general, both people in employment and those in full-time education believe that people should be allowed to keep most of what they earn and that it is OK for those who work harder or who are more productive to earn more”. He went on to say, “When people become unemployed, our study indicates that they let go of this belief. They put a higher value on the redistribution of money, which, in social terms, would mean higher taxes on those earning more in order to fund increased public spending.”   --go figure...   http://phys.org/.../2016-04-employment-status-affects...
2016-04-12	MOST peon liberals are an exception...they ALWAYS want to redistribute...mostly because government is their deity...and chances are some or all of their income is government derived...ie; government workers,contractors,academia etcetcetc...and i ain't talkin' about seniors,military,cops,firefighters...VAST majority of them ain't todays U.S. peon liberals

2016-04-12	Victor Soto You are wrong and they already have voted in past elections in various states and the liberals are trying to get them to vote even more. In fact in New Mexico, one politician recently admitted that she voted in an election in the state several years ago while she still was illegally in this country. So you can deny it all you want and call people names, Victor, but the Democraps are kissing the butts of the illegals to get their votes and keep the party in power and control in this country for many years to come.

2016-04-12	Undocumented immigrants are people who shouldn't be here to begin with. Democratic elected officials violate their oaths of office by looking the other way when these criminals break into our country illegally. They do so in the hopes that , if they can somehow make these criminals into citizens, they'll vote Democratic later on. They pander to these ILLEGALS by coming up with perks such as undocumented driver's licenses. They put their party above their country. That's just wrong.
2016-04-12	Actually it was geared towards undocumented immigrants from South, Central America and Mexico. The drivers licences were proposed as a way to make sure that immigrants who were not citizens would have documentation that specifically stated that, so that they could not vote in any elections. Undocumented immigrants were being used by the large corporations to work for below minimum wages, and the Republicans didn't want to do anything about that. The goal was to easily check, and keep an eye on who lived where, if they were working and not paying taxes, if they were being used by large corpo...See More

What are they really trying to cover up?   I'm sending this to all my friends, family and patriot brothers......See More
2016-04-12	Totally agree with him. This nation should be building bridges and not walls. This nation is built on the backs of immigrants. I also feel we should do a better job in helping the Native American Indians we helped destroy as well. No one really talks about that. They seriously need help with infrastructure and schools and hospitals.
2016-04-12	Bernie Sanders and his minions are DISGUSTING low lifes. Please crawl back under the rocks you came from.

2016-04-12	Syed Mohammad Faheem This is nothing but a link people copy most likely Sanders supporters. I read the exact same comment word for word posted by a different person on another article on Politico's page dealing with Bernie Sanders. What a bunch of fakes!!
2016-04-12	I've really never seen a preemptive attack on a VP selection. What the hell is going on over there progressives? Sanders might want to step in and say something. This looks bad.
2016-04-12	Just Sandernistas trying to undermine Hillary Clinton by any method possible. They have no loyalty to the Democratic Party, and keep so demonstrating.
2016-04-12	It's Sander's supporters realizing that their man has lost and they are determined to tarnish as many people as possible before the lights go out. It's shameful.
2016-04-12	Its just further evidence that Clinton loves Wall Street and doesnt see any problem with Wall Street destroying the Housing Market and then, secretly with the help of her little buddy Julian, they are now buying up all those homes at rock bottom prices.      Steal from the poor, give to the rich. It's the Corporate Way.
2016-04-12	Talking about creep...This guy looks like a real creep...It would be a perfect fit for the islamist anti-American communist dem party.

2016-04-12	Reality is a cold slap in the face. All the bogus links/memes/pics against Secretary Hillary Clinton do not matter. This is all that matters. Secretary Clinton is now leading Uncle Burnie and The Donald by YUGE numbers. With Secretary Clinton’s expected victories in upcoming primaries in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, etc., I will start focusing most of my attention on the General Election. I am certain U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders will endorse Secretary Clinton within a few weeks after she sweeps through these states. He will join Secretary Clinton on stage at the L...See More
2016-04-12	I have more faith in Sanders doing the right thing than his minions,.
2016-04-12	Stephen McDonald Why is Sanders working so hard to make his supporters hate Hillary, including through the use of inflammatory disinformation, exactly like the Republicans? He has no interest in the future welfare of the United States; only his own welfare.
2016-04-12	Well said!
2016-04-12	Julián Castro is a brilliant young man and was a shining star in Texas politics fighting for the little guy.   He would be a great choice for HRC's VP. He could incentivize millions of Latinos to vote in the General. Progressives attack him at the risk of seeming petty and exposing themselves for the bullies that they are.
2016-04-12	Why is he helping Wall Street buy up all the homes that Banks forclosed on during the financial crisis though?
2016-04-12	Adam Sinclair   Who else could buy them Adam? But big banks? It's not like   people had money to purchase them, or have you forgotten?   People needed to get out from under the debt. There were no jobs.
2016-04-12	Adam Sinclair I think they are buying up the foreclosed mortgages. Are you offering to buy some? If not, then who should?
2016-04-12	Heidi did have a plan to impact us all. Virgin Heidi working with the no-borders Globalists as a CFR member( Council of Foreign Relations) wrote a plan to do away with America's borders and turn Mexico, USA, and Canada into a European Union style "community". No borders, no passports needed, no security checks. HEIDI, why did Liar Ted wait until May 2014 to surrender his Canadian citizenship??
2016-04-12	Nobody cares Heidi...
2016-04-12	Heidi doesn't even care.   Politico seemed to think this would be a great click bait article for the rabid Trumpanzees.
2016-04-12	Here we go again. Whose wife is the sleaziest. Yep the GOP candidates are talking about policy. Nothing ever changes
2016-04-12	Trump's campaign is being run like a high school Twitter war.   Pretty much suits the mentality of his brain dead supporters.
2016-04-12	Heidi Cruz was a Vice President at Goldman Sachs & Co. · 2005 - 2012 while Goldman Sachs was Fleecing America....just sayin
2016-04-12	Trump has to win it on the first ballot. Cruz knows how to use delegate and convention rules to his advantage, and consequently he would have a great chance to win it on the second or third ballot. But if it goes beyond a second or third ballot, my guess is that the convention will choose someone like Romney, Rubio, or Kasich. Kasich needs to at least surpass Rubio's delegate haul to be taken remotely seriously at that point.

2016-04-12	Yep, a large number of Trumps delegates are actually Cruz supporters. As soon as they are unbound they will switch. It all depends how many become unbound after the first vote.      It's going to be mayhem whatever happens.
2016-04-12	But it's not a sure thing that you're able to serve. All those Trumpheads, you stealking the election and then losing the general, I'd seriously watch my back. And don't go to any parties where the main course is Roast Rafael.
2016-04-12	Trump is toast !!!

2016-04-12	A Jesus freak married to a Wall Street banker. If this isn’t a commentary on today’s GOP I don’t know what is.
2016-04-12	I just love how when it's convienent for him to do so, he's denouncing a contested covention as some pipedream of the establishment. But as soon as a contested covention suits him, he's talking it up like it's been his plan all along (which if you check his organization, it really has).
2016-04-12	Now, there is a pair to draw to.

2016-04-12	Trump in 2000: "I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. With today’s internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record.”      Trump in 2016: "Whatever you want to hear."

2016-04-12	Trump will change his mind on the second amendment a dozen times by this speech in May. Trump probably doesn't know what the second amendment is. He is such a dumb#ss. #NeverTrump
2016-04-12	I hope they catch him on a day when he is pro gun ,will the audience have a "right to carry " that day, Or will their constitutional rights be violated at the NRA meeting
2016-04-12	I think you should reevaluate your comment. Trump owns firearms and he was the only one who is not a politican who brought to light what is going on in our country. All the rest of the establishment talked a good talk and tried to walk the walk but were full of it. The Republicans let the illegal, Mulims, liar into office and I could mention who, but you should do your home work.
2016-04-12	So vote for Hillary Clinton who has said she would do away with our Second Amendment, and then she went to Pennsylvania and told a different story. If what you say is true, do you think he would be a Second term president. You should do a lot of reserach on the other canidates running for office. Donald Trump has brought forht many issues that other canidates hide behind.
2016-04-12	Guests lists. Hmm. All Republican. Hmm. All bought and paid for by NRA lobby. Hmm. I wonder which party has my vote?

2016-04-12	Sara Brightman Flat out false. Bernie has been long on pie in the sky promises and short on policy detail. His performance with the NY Daily News was so horrendous, they have endorsed Hillary and said this about Bernie.....      " Subjected to meaningful scrutiny for the first time, the senator from Vermont proved utterly unprepared for the Oval Office while confirming that the central thrusts of his campaign are politically impossible.      Which, paradoxically, is good news, because some of the most prominent Sanderisms would likely wreak epic economic damage."      And that was one of the nicer comments.      Read the whole article.......See More
2016-04-12	I think it might be a nasty one and the real loser will be whoever gets the nomination since the GOP will likely get good negative stuff on both candidates. Can't be helped I guess since Bernie will not go quietly and Hillary sure as hell ain't going to show any weakness or unwillingness to fight fire with fire. You just don't dare to rise above the crap fest especially since Dukakis famously made that mistake when he ran against Bush.

2016-04-12	With a third of the US still to vote, telling people that their vote doesnt count is the best way I can think of to get voters to come out and vote. And they wont be voting for Clinton with her ive already won attitude. If Sanders gets 55 to 60 % of the vote in NY,NJ,Pa, & Ca he will pull even with her. He isnt leaving before the convention and Im not so sure the political strategy that Clinton is trying to use wont hurt her more than help her. Americans get pretty rilled up about that sort of thing.

2016-04-12	When cranky mad-at-the-world Sanders continually attacks President Clinton's record and bad-mouths his wife in that same regard, then yes, he should defend his record. While Bill Clinton was spending 8 years in the White House, Sanders was doing what he does best, and has been doing for decades. Absolutely nothing.
2016-04-12	Well, Bill actually spent some time being impeached too...turned an intern into a cigar humidor so some of it was not in the WH thank God.

2016-04-12	"You will recall that Clinton won the presidency after running as a populist alternative to the aristocratic George H. W. Bush; almost immediately after being elected, however, he chose to make financial markets his number one constituency. To satisfy those markets, he made reducing the federal deficit his top priority; he cut capital-gains taxes; he deregulated the banking industry; he ensured that derivatives would face no government scrutiny; and he cheered for the bull market as though it were an achievement of the average citizen: “How can any American, of any station in life, not be proud of the financial markets we have built,” he said in 1997." - Thomas Frank, "Listen, Liberal"

2016-04-12	I like Sanders' idealism. We need idealistic members of Congress where they can have an impact without running a utiopian show. But idealism like Sanders' is not suited to the White House where he would be the only, fantastically impractical voice.
2016-04-12	Unfortunately idealism doesn't lead to accomplishment and moving the country forward.      Base hits are what win baseball games, swing for the fense at every at bat leads to a lot of strike outs.
2016-04-12	Scott Henricks What you call "idealism" is IDEAS. This country was founded on new and good IDEAS and that is what Hillary LACKS completely. She just steals Bernie Sanders' positions on issues and then claims she is the continuation of Obama's presidency. Does Hillary Clinton have one original IDEA of her own??
2016-04-12	David Kent -- that's nonsense.... The truth is that Hillary has no ideas of her own so she just steals everyone else's.
2016-04-12	Of course they did, 92% of the media votes democrat, and the well known hang around with the rich democratic establishment.
2016-04-12	92%? I would just love to see the data that supports your statement. I doubt that. NY is a solid blue fortress, Sanders really had little chance there
2016-04-12	There has to be a reason why this is the case, no?   Is it perhaps because the majority of the electorate tends to vote Democrat & the media wants to appeal to the majority of their readers?   There certainly are equal numbers among the rich republican establishment for them to hang around with I would think.

2016-04-12	They've given a detailed analysis for why they made this choice. Bernie's lack of knowledge was damning. That interview with him has to be seen/heard to be believed.

2016-04-12	He was invited, and it's not something he'd pass up. He's gone for 1.5 days and should get some good press out of it.
2016-04-12	John Smith Sanders is no youngster, jet lag and all that. Being aligned with South American socialists, smart? Not sure who made the decision but it isn't smart.      s
2016-04-12	Quite a contrast. Bernie goes to the Vatican to talk inequality and Hillary goes jetting around begging for money from the rich and begging hard.   If your smart you know who to vote for.
2016-04-12	Bernie is spending more than $100,000 on a private jet to Rome so he can give a ten-minute talk during a coffee break.      If he was worried about inequality, he'd stay home, videoconference the event, and give the $100,000 to the needy.
2016-04-12	and Bernie took a slow boat to the Vatican, buy a clue. You better send him another couple checks he will need to spend uuuugggggeeee in Penn to make up for New York.
2016-04-12	Oh Lord.      Th head of the vatican group that actually invited him have called him out for his using the invitation as a brazen, callow and callous political stunt.      Stop being such a hypocritical dufus bro.
2016-04-12	What could go wrong with Sanders burnishing his socialist credentials. Good luck with that Bernie.
2016-04-12	Yes, because all you smart people know what democratic socialism is, which is why you were so proud to go to a public school, drive on the roads we have, rely on firemen to protect you and your home from fire, police to catch someone who robs your home - because surely you know all these are socialist programs and exactly the kind of democratic socialism that Bernie talks about, which after all is as American as apple pie.
2016-04-12	JayZ fans for Bernie Sanders --   Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City   & we are fans of Jimmy Kimmel & JayZ! Enjoy -   Jay Z Performs "Empire State of Mind" in Brooklyn   https://youtu.be/qooJO1JjkUw
2016-04-12	Sandrine Burn Do you understand that most of the American Public doesn't see it that way, right or wrong? It's not that Democratic Socialism is wrong, far from it. It's that in today's political climate, saying that you're a socialist on camera makes you unelectable. Same with saying you're going to raise everyone's taxes. It's why the Republicans have taken aim at Hillary but left Sanders alone, because if he wins, then you'll see wall to wall ads using Sanders own words against him. Sanders is a liability and the only shot that the Republicans have to win the election.
2016-04-12	He should do a live video conference for the meeting and stay in NY! Though I love the contrast between Hillary's trip and his. But she is winning and can afford to leave...
2016-04-12	Your idea of a "contrast" is actually both candidates working to appeal to their base.   It's called Politics as usual.
2016-04-12	Blame somebody else. She's learned well from Obama. Fact is the folks who should be offended by this don't care what liberals refer to them as. Just so long as the free stuff keeps coming.
2016-04-12	The "free stuff" conservatives have been shoveling to THEIR constituency - corporate America - absolutely DWARFS anything hurting Americans have gotten.
2016-04-12	Mark Willis nothing has cost more and returned less than the social spending that started under "The Great Society". Not even close.
2016-04-12	Bill Shailor      You're quite the rube fella.      Talk radio has eaten your brain.
2016-04-12	Of course it was his fault, ObamaBoys in 08 BernieBros in '16, Obama wants your guns in 08 Sanders loves guns that killed children in 16, Obama takes to much wall street money in 08 Sanders exaggerates wall street donations in 16, and on and on. Pivot and shift when needed, talk about black people killed by police and Flint until voting is done then never mention again.
2016-04-12	Yeah it's his fault. He forced her to participate in it. Some leadership qualities on full display there.
2016-04-12	Daniel Younan Please tell us you are studying sanitation engineering in that school, and not medicine. The sheer amount shit you shovel here- boy, don't let that talent go waste!
2016-04-12	Jay Majumdar ... Go back to school and stop using broken English !
2016-04-12	If a white republican male was even remotely involved in a skit like this, he'd be hounded night and day until he withdrew his candidacy. Recall the " Maccaca" moment?
2016-04-12	I'd rather die than agree with you, but it's a fair point. I wish she was getting a lot more heat for it. Seems like her campaign thought, because she's winning the black vote in the primaries, she'd try to act "down". What an idiot.
2016-04-12	where's that Teddy Roosevelt sense of humor? This one is completely innocent (we can't tease someone or even a whole group of people for BEING LATE? it would be a cool thing if said about me. means you're not a robot, life has a way to mess up your schedule (good, we need a bit more improvisation, oh darn, I just made a jazz joke, would it be interpreted as racially charged?).   And, of course, jokes depend on context. It helps when the person telling the joke is doing so openly, teasingly, happens to be married to a black person and is known for a civil right agenda. As opposed to a party that can only grow by attracting the poorly educated into an ethnically charged agenda (just like the southern Democrats of yore).
2016-04-12	Bill Shailor Well, Hillary is a white republican female, so what's good for the gander is good for the goose. Hillary should withdraw her candidacy for participating is a racist joke.
2016-04-12	It was a joke. People have to learn to relax.
2016-04-12	Spot on. It was just a joke. I also like Hillary Clinton intelligent answer in the article.
2016-04-12	Okey Francis Nwanekezie Would you have been okay with everyone saying that sir?
2016-04-12	Okey Francis Nwanekezie A joke, at it's core, is intended to be funny. There is nothing funny about the stereotype that black people can't be on time. This was a racist statement made by DeBlasio and co-signed by Hillary Clinton. Before we get so anxious to give out free passes for stupidity, let's wait for the Italian, Jew, Polish, Mexican "jokes". My guess, you'll be waiting until you're no longer on this planet.
2016-04-12	This is what offends people nowadays. Amazing.
2016-04-12	Uh, a millionaire old out of touch white lady joking about black people? Yeah, it's awash with nasty privilege, and gross to watch. Have you seen the video? Do you know anything about the history (or present) of race in America?
2016-04-12	Simon Magus , you realize how cheaply you're selling the extremely troubling history of this country? Move on, this joke is just fine. What's not fine and we should talk about is real discrimination and there's qute a bit of it in our country -in the workplace, etc, affecting minorities and women as well. Let's focus on that. No doubt we agree on the issue. I just don't see the line on the sand here: it's a joke, well intended.

I voted mainly Tepublican but now refuse to vote for them until the exorcise the Tea Party demon. Take back the Party of Lincoln. Make the Republican Party what it was under Lincoln.
2016-04-12	Highly doubt you've ever voted Republican in your life, especially since you contradict yourself by saying you voted for Tea Party Rs, then saying they are demons.      And I've never heard anyone except Ds refer to Tea Party Rs, as "Tepublicans." Nice try thi.
2016-04-12	Jamie Berry That was a typo. And yes I used to vote for Republicans.
2016-04-12	This is the first thing I've seen that should make Donald Trump worried about New York.      Rove says you're golden.      Uh-oh ...
2016-04-12	I'll have to see it to believe it.      The New York Republican Party has usually been a moderate, responsible party. I just find it very hard to believe that Trump will get over 50% there when he hasn't anywhere else.      Embracing Trump makes them look really bad and it'll make holding the Senate much harder for them.
2016-04-12	He hasn't got over 50% mainly because of the crowded field of candidates until fairly recently.
2016-04-12	Jamie Berry True, to a certain extent, except that Cruz and Kasich have picked up nearly 85% of the votes from Rubio and the other candidates that dropped out.      There is serious resistance to Trump, that's simply a fact. It'll be interesting to see if New York and the other Northeastern states like Maryland really buck that trend and embrace Trump so strongly - beyond the 35% or 40% Trump zealots.
2016-04-12	How long has this idiot lived in NY and not been registered to vote? I only lived there for 4 years and registered within a month of moving there.
2016-04-12	She is clearly registered to vote. Over 40% of Americans are not registered with either party. In New York, the deadline to change party affiliation was October 9th, and the deadline to register to vote for the first time was the end of March. No other state has a similar gap, so Ivanka Trump is 100% correct to say New York is particularly bad with allowing Independents to vote in primaries. The real issue here is with closed primaries that disenfranchise a huge number of Americans who are forced to participate in the corrupt two party system.
2016-04-12	Syed Mohammad Faheem please learn how to speak & write . Please try and read your comment . You were saying...?
2016-04-12	Tom Planamento How is excluding people who are not members of the party "disenfranchising"? Primaries are not in the constitution, they are creatures created by political parties, who have a complete right to designate who the party will support in the general election. Why should democrats have a nominating process open to republicans who can intentionally vote for someone they think has a weaker chance in the general election? People who complain that primaries aren't "democratic" are idiots. Political parties are not democracies, they are private membership associations. Party leaders can create a rule that says whoever catches the most pigeons will be the nominee. If you don't like it, don't join the party.
2016-04-12	I guess they've had no interest in voting until it benefits to them.

2016-04-12	I'm not a politician, but as a resdent of New York State, I KNOW what the rules are about voter registration. She's as clueless as her father. What a bunch. And the lowlifes who support donald actually believe this billionaire cares about them! hahahahahahahaha

2016-04-12	The bit where Eric spouts off about how amazing it is and how much work they did on voter reg. It's about as unselfaware a statement as I could imagine.
2016-04-12	She's probably not clueless like her father has been in this campaign.      I know a few businessmen, and their natural instinct on politics is to register and stay independent to keep their options open.      That's pragmatic and all, but it goes to show how the Trump family has and still has absolutely zero loyalty to the Republican Party or conservatism.
2016-04-12	So let's review things he thought were good ideas, repeal Glass Stegal - great recession, NAFTA, NK deal. Sorry Bill but your legacy of failure you have no cred.

2016-04-12	Mwema Kerich - Like all Presidents, often too much blame and too much credit are assigned to Presidents. Giving Bill credit for a budget surplus is a huge stretch because it would not have existed with the budget proposals he submitted to Congress so some credit for the questionable budget surplus does belong with Congress. Anthony seems to be suggesting Glass Stegal and the fact it was repealed under Bill Clinton as a major factor contributing to or causing the great rececssion which I am guessing was the global financial meltdown at the end of the Bush era.

2016-04-12	Sure Bill. Muslims have been so good for the country so far. All one has to do is look to Dearborn and Minneapolis to see how much they have helped. They were also great in the deconstruction of the World Trade Centers. And the Mosques they build are great when it comes to recruiting and training more bombers. Shut up and go away and take your dumbass wife with you.
2016-04-12	That syphilis has finally come home to roost..      A new ICM poll has discovered two out of three Muslims in Britain would not give the government any information if they knew details about a terror plot.
2016-04-12	Any serious student of history should be seriously suspicious of allowing mass Muslim migration into this country.      From the beginnings of Islam until today, they have an unfortunate tendency towards jihad. They destroyed Western Roman civilization in the Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey. And sadly, Islam has never undergone the Reformation that Christianity did in the 16th and 17th centuries.      Importing a bunch of Muslims from Muslim countries is simply not a good idea. I'm sorry, political correctness fails here because far too many practitioners of Islam simply refuse to accept Western liberal values. You can't grant tolerance to the intolerant, and if the Democratic Party doesn't recognize that, it should be disavowed.

And even better,if the entire national debt exceeds 2% of gross GDP no Congress member ever is eligible for reelection.

2016-04-13	If the house and senate cannot pass a budget, then they should not be paid by the people until they are able to pass a budget. Time to hold them accountable for doing actual work, not giving political speeches about why they cannot support this or that.

No.      Tragic because we could never trust in government again. It feels very much to me like if we can't elect an honest person in this election when the Republicans are killing themselves for us, and settle for holding our noses for Hillary, we will never be able to elect an honest person in a competitive year.      I don't care if Sanders is the worst thing for the Democratic party. He is the best thing for the country. Try to keep the bigger picture in mind without inserting content that does not exist.

2016-04-13	"Having a good voting record" is kinda the minimum duty of his job, after showing up for work.   Where are all his accomplishments over 30 years? If he's going to persuade all 50 states to have a "revolution" then why can't he persuade more co-workers to support him?

2016-04-13	yay
2016-04-13	Here's a reminder: Sanders won the last 8/9 states despite Hillary polling better than Sanders in those states. Yet here we are, reading yet another poll showing Hillary is leading. Don't take it seriously because it's meaningless.
2016-04-13	Sanders only win in caucus where there is most whites. There is not the numbers of delegates to sanders to pass Clinton. He have to win 70% of the remaining states to beat Clinton. NOT going to happend.
2016-04-13	Jon Fulton oh Bernie bro why are you lying. You know that's not true. Sanders was always polling way ahead of Clinton In all white states like Idaho Utah Wyoming Maine Alaska WA and KS. Bernie panders is mostly winning small all white caucus states. Caucus is so undemocratic because it leaves out and deny so many workers like nurses and police, fire, and emergency workers and service industry workers like waitresses, part time workers and shift workers who cannot leave their jobs at a said specific time because they have to work. Majority of These voters are Hillary Clinton supporters. It's not like a primary where you have all day to vote or send in absentees Ballots. You have to show up in person . Only the privilege white folks who have 9-5 jobs can go caucus. Bernie is only winning when he disenfranchise people from voting. This is shameful.

2016-04-13	The betting houses had their odds on that since the beginning.
2016-04-13	I don't think Trump will get enough delegates to secure the nomination before the convention. There's little chance he'd be the GOP nominee in a brokered convention, despite him being ahead both in delegate count and popular vote.
2016-04-13	Ignacio Martín I think you are wrong. If he doesn't get to the magic number, I would expect that some deal making will be going on behind the scenes. If he gets 1,100 or more, my bet is that there will be a deal with Kasich or Rubio to release their delegates to Trump.
2016-04-13	what happened to that Cruzmentum we heard so much about
2016-04-13	Bernie needs to win 57 percent of the outstanding votes to overtake Hillary in the pledged delegate race. That is just impossible considering that more or less half of the Democratic voters in NY, CA, PA, MD, DE, CT, NJ and NM are blacks and Latinos. Exit polls have shown that Hillary enjoys the consistent solid support from these minority groups. Bernie would have a hard time winning those states let alone get 57% of the votes or win by a 14-point margin. Moreover, these states have closed primaries which means that independents cannot vote and Bernie can't rely on them to earn a huge victory.
2016-04-13	It really amazes me that in every single article Politco STILL lists the superdelegates in Clintons totals as if they have already voted.      Its been posted at least a dozen times that they need to stop doing this. It is an obvious attempt to suppress Bernie Sanders voters by making it seem that Clintons lead is insurmountable. Not a single superdelegate has voted yet and including their voted in the totals is an intentional deception by the Politco writers.      Stop it Politico.

2016-04-13	Wow, Lauren Brown, your're such a "democrat".
2016-04-13	Rewriting rules? Sounds more like Hillary Clinton's attempt to make democrats less honest, more open to pandering, less worried about what's moral or ethical, and more prone to switching a position when it doesn't win votes.      Bernie has 50+ years of consistency on the issues. Hillary started off as a young conservative who worked hard for Goldwater and was against gay marriage until 2013. I want to know what my President plans to do with our country and there is no conceivable way to know which position Secretary Clinton will take once she holds the highest position in this nation. Bernie is consistent and trustworthy. Any candidate who can sweep their state in the primaries tells me everything I need to know about the job they've been doing.
2016-04-13	please remove the superdelegates from the graphic

2016-04-13	Yes, imagine that. The DNC is set up so that it doesn't get taken hostage by some fire-breathing populist who, by his own admission, is only running in the Democratic primary so that he can make use of DNC machinery.
2016-04-13	He'll be looking for a job come November
2016-04-13	Oh I do not think so. People like you will be picking up the pieces of what is left of the GOP or not.

2016-04-13	Oh boy. He is a senator and not up for re-election. If he is the vp nominee he will not surrender his senate seat until after the election, which Clinton and he would win by quite a lot.
2016-04-13	The press needs to step back and take a deep breath instead of trying to control the message of who will be the the person selected as VP for the Democrats. You already have enough to write about the Republicans and you already tried to stir the pot with the Democrats with that Washington Post article about the qualified as President aricle that was never said nor true. Just to let you know, the public which has grown tired of your antics are now getting pretty pissed. Some advice. Pour a glass of wine. Smell the aroma and do your job instead of creating the news.

I am more than sure that you will get best result.   Best Of Luck for new Initiative!      https://www.facebook.com/Prove-Your-Living.../...
2016-04-13	In other words, I accept.
2016-04-13	All VP candidates will have to contribute to the Clinton "Foundation" for their   names to be considered. The amount of the contribution will be taken into consideration   of course. But personal attributes will not be ignored altogether. Good luck men. (And it   will be a man.)
2016-04-13	It was nice of him to acknowledge the service to Virginia of Republican John Warner. He certainly isn't the only Dem who appreciated Warner's ability to reach across the aisle to get things done; to encourage progress.
2016-04-13	Bernie supporters = Trump supporters. Same tactics. The candidates bear some responsibility for this. They are both promoting this nonsense with heated rhetoric.
2016-04-13	in that both supporters are against 1%....but trump supporters = racism/anti- education/climate change...
2016-04-13	Sara Brightman Their politics might be on two ends of the spectrum but their tactics are not. THAT is the point.
2016-04-13	Lou Kaye   Why care what's in them? It's none of our business.
2016-04-13	More of the Sanders trademark bullying. Where are those tax returns Bernie? What are you hiding? The people want to know.
2016-04-13	Jane Sanders cannot seem to find hers and Bernie's tax returns. Just like she could not find the time to keep the universityi she Presidented from going into bankruptcy....
2016-04-13	Lou Kaye Sanders won't release them. They show a huge amount of income. Just start: with $176,000 salary, for which he has done nothing for ONE year; with $46,000 in Social Security benefits. How much has the campaign paid Jane Sanders for standing there and doing nothing. How much has he reported for capital gains? How much has he reported for rental properties income? How much from his huge US Government retirement package that you paid for? It is a very, very large income. They are multi-millionaires but try to plead poverty - that they are just like you. Ha!!! Has he reported her $200,000 package that Burlington College paid her to get the hell out? She took the college to the brink of bankruptcy. So, until many more people bark, like he does, about not releasing his taxes, we will never see them.
2016-04-13	I'm curious...what do you think he is hiding? He is the poorest member of Congress. Why the Hail Mary play?
2016-04-13	The delegates are big boys and girls. Pretending they are being "bullied" is nonsense.
2016-04-13	Totally agree, and am surprised that this is something MoveOn wants to take on.   The super delegate "scheme" was created following George McGovern's big loss in 1972. The idea was these party regular-party elites could stop an insurgent candidate that the mainstream party did not endorse. In that Bernie continues to win primaries/caucuses yet gets fewer delegates than Clinton in doing so shows you the plan is working just fine.      Between the super delegate House of Lords scheme, the fact that 33 state Dem committees started working "for" Clinton as of August 2015 (before a single vote could be cast) proves this was never going to be allowed to be anything but a coronation. Do you think it's just a coincidence that Sanders and O'Malley were the only competition? Everyone else saw immediately that the game was rigged, and the fix was in.
2016-04-13	Winston Herzog   Faux Democracy. The poobahs rigged it. The unwashed enjoy the appearance of a   say without actual input. One maintains ones power as one keeps the masses happy.   Putin does the same thing. The masses may chose from a pre-selected listing of   approved candidates.
2016-04-13	Why can't they do it respectfully? Is it really that hard to politely ask them to change their vote? One superdelegate was called a bitch. This really hurts Sanders. He loses supporters or potential supporters because of these idiots. I wouldn't judge him for it because he doesn't have control over them but then again, he needs to publicly tell them to stop and he hasn't.
2016-04-13	Bernie is Desperate. Witness: Sanders campaign is currently characterizing any Clinton SuperDelegate as Corrupt. That makes about as much sense as Bernie trying to characterize Hillary as "unqualified" simply because she disagrees with him....
2016-04-13	of course sanders is desperate....you would be desperate if the game was "rigged" with wall street/hedge fund   super delegates against you!
2016-04-13	They are not against him, they support the party. He has railed against super delegates and the party. Meanwhile she has done fundraising in every state for state parties and down ticket candidates. She's so far ahead, she won't need them. He does. Rather than wooing, he's gone with harassing. Classy.
2016-04-13	Maybe, Amy Carson but he would be smarter to stick to the issues. Going negative seems like the wrong strategy. Tell me what you'll do for me (besides breaking up the banks) and I'll respond. Drag that other candidate through the mud and I'm turned off.
2016-04-13	Penny White "Meanwhile she has bribed party officials in every state for state parties and down ticket candidates"      Fixed that for you.
2016-04-13	Why not? Some will; some won't.
2016-04-13	Because George......it smacks of McCarthy like tactics. Either you trust the process (and take the time to LEARN it ) or you don't.      That is what IMHO makes Trump crying about the delagate process a very bad joke......that man has looked at being President sincee 2000 and you are telling me a man with his business sense can't hire folks who KNOW the rules. IF anyone came to me no matter the party and asked me to sign such a thing "voluntary" or not (and the way Roger Stone is acting you KNOW it wouldn't be voluntary) I would tell them to go away.      The same thing with the Bernie supporters going after superdelagates - welcome to the process. You sdon't have to like it but you have to deal with it.
2016-04-13	Nazi pledge to Hitler.      Hugo Chavez had those.
2016-04-13	Roland Miller Thank you!! I've been saying this all week...if Bernie didn't like the process of the Democratic Party, maybe he should have not pretended to be one to try to get the nomination. He is running for his Senate seat as an Independent again.   Same with Trump. The process will not be changed because some millionaire throws a hissy fit and threatens violence. In fact, both those things should disqualify the man.
2016-04-13	"four days of NON VIOLENT demonstrations"" Yes - from Trump supporters. This should go well...
2016-04-13	So the one guy who first was opposed to signing the loyalty pledge, is now asking his delegates to sign a loyalty pledge.............................Priceless!

2016-04-13	and then cool your heels on ice
2016-04-13	What is it with Trump and loyalty pledges and oaths? It smacks of something not seen in American politics? Delegates have always had their conscience and character to do the right thing which was good enough until Trump came along.
2016-04-13	This is communist and third reich country. It also circumvents the rules of each state which govern loyalty.
2016-04-13	But it HAS been seen..Inauguration Day 2009. Unelected lobbyist Grover Norquist meets with a bunch of top level GOP Congressmen and gets them to sign a pledge that they will never vote yes on anything Obama proposes. And let us not forget Tehran Tom and his signed by 47 members letter to Iran warning them not to trust the USA. The GOP has sold themselves to Satan. Trump is the personification of what they have become.
2016-04-13	Susan Gessford I think this is unusal in that its for a political convention where the pledge is to elect a candidate and not just an issue. You can't know what is going to happen at the convention to change one's opinion of that candidate, he could go off the rails. He's already said some pretty outrageous things.
2016-04-13	Nothing is stacked. The Colorado process has been in place since the mid 1990's. It's Rump's tough luck that he didn't check this out.
2016-04-13	It wasn't tough luck.. it was his arrogance and ego that caused this...
2016-04-13	What sounds dishonest to me was the fact that Trump delegates were replaced. Like the gentleman who burned his republican papers on youtube. He said he was a delegate and they deliberately replaced him because he was a Trump voter. Then the tweet that took place and was quickly removed. Sorry, but I am far from naive!!
2016-04-13	Linda Crimeni Duncan NO, acutally you ARE Niave! You dont think Little Donnie is behind all these games? Come on, you are being played like a violin. Trump owns the media, let alone uses it. Media manipulation at its finest and most dangerous

2016-04-13	One of the reasons I support both Trump and Sanders is in the hopes that Americans become more privy to the corruption we have. When party activists in Colorado can choose delegates without any input from the voters, and those activists are establishment supporters, there is nothing that will persuade those activists to pick any delegates who support an insurgent candidate. The entire process is designed to stop insurgent candidates (which is what Trump is).      Of course, the exploiter-funded pundits who call Trump a "whiner" and a "loser" because he didn't get any of the Colorado delegates fail...See More
2016-04-13	Gary Smith Mr. Smith, precisely why I am a staunch supporter of Mr. Trump - to tell the establishment we the people are sick and tired of their thinking they "own" us and we are their subjects/slaves, their personal unlimited debit cards. Congress and the WH have done nothing for we the people except send us the bill for their overblown paychecks, golden parachutes, and glorious benefits; they have increased the national debt using our grandkids, as well as future generations as indentured servants to pay off Congress and the WH's overblown "lack of" budget.

2016-04-13	Funny the Trump people accepted the results in Hawaii, which has the EXACT SAME PROCESS. Just a pack of whiny losers.
2016-04-13	Please explain better. You know you're lying.
2016-04-13	Hawaii uses the same Caucus-convention-delegate system as Colorado. In Hawaii, Trump supporters actually bothered to participate and won; In Colorado, VERY FEW Trump supporters showed up for the caucuses and they got slaughtered. So Trump whines about the PROCESS in Colorado, when it's his SUPPORTERS that failed.
2016-04-13	Mike Openshaw ARE YOU A REPUBLICAN? OR, a TROLL???
2016-04-13	One more instance where Trump's ignorance of the facts results in sour grapes. This brilliant winner who says 'trust me' can't be trusted after all to know what he's doing. Why is it he's having problems and everyone else knew what they needed to do? One more conspiracy to add to Trump's list of them. If he can't navigate the primaries how is he going to handle the Congress or world bodies? I expect if successful, all you are going to get from him are excuses. Trump's new tag should be I'm a winner or have a good excuse.

2016-04-13	Pay for what? Is that the best that you can argue. Os, so far I have not able to sort out your moronic rant
2016-04-13	Kasich is a joke at this point. He's in fourth place in a three man race.
2016-04-13	Kasich's thesis is that he can help deny Trump the nomination by winning states in the east. Polling suggests he's wrong. He's in the 20's in NY, CT, MD, and PA. He ought to drop out after New York. At that point it's going to be obvious he's not succeeding in his plan to win eastern states and is only helping Trump win the nomination by splintering the vote.
2016-04-13	Jon Worley Is it possible that by him dropping out it would help Trump even more? Especially in the remaining proportional / WTM states that award by congressional districts? I would expect some of Kasich support would either not vote or vote for Trump.
2016-04-13	you're the fucking joke
2016-04-13	WTF...that was three different numbers. 1237, 1100, and 1000. What a mess.....
2016-04-13	Ytap Gaspar Jaimes I don't watch videos.
2016-04-13	Del Ray This post has shown up on multiple comment boards.
2016-04-13	There's no mess. 1237 is 50% +1. That's what you need to win. That's what every candidate has always needed to win. If you don't get to 50% + 1, you don't have a majority and you're not the nominee. When he references 1100 he's saying that if Trump get's THAT close on the first ballot, the unbound delegates will likely switch and put him over the top. The 1000 comes into play because he's saying if he gets less than that there's very little chance he'll get enough delegates on the first day. This stuff really isn't that complicated. The fact that Trump is unable to comprehend simple math and simple rules is why this is a problem for him to begin with.
2016-04-13	after 50 plus yearsas a Republican I just realized the Republican Party just nothing but a private club controlled by the leaders Washington DC which Direct the organizations throughout the country this is not the way the Constitution was was established on the two party system based on The Voice of the people not the people good now run the club this spending Millions to stop Trump and stifle the voice of the people time to wake up before it's too late Colorado is the perfect example and that's just the beginning of the next few months
2016-04-13	Yes..All of these years we were brought up to believe that ANYONE can be president...What they failed to disclose is that you must be a part of the fraternity FIRST..and have the approval of that group before you can run...Isn't that a kick in the face of everything we were taught?
2016-04-13	The two party system is established in the Constitution? Please tell me where the Constitution discusses parties at all. When you claim a Republican for 50 years, did you not learn anything about Government during that long time?
2016-04-13	All political parties are private clubs. That's what a political party is. Except for pohibitions on discimination and charging money to join, it can run itself internally any way it wants. The constitution and the law cares no more about the internal workings of a political party than it does you neighborhood book club. Americans need to learn how our system actually works.

2016-04-13	The article is amazingly incomplete.. Fails to deal with obvious question of " How can Trump win with less then 1,237 delegates".
2016-04-13	Right? Woefully incomplete. Weird.
2016-04-13	Exactly. Is he saying that there are enough uncommitted delegates who would say "close enough," and climb aboard or... something else? Anybody see the segment able to comment on whether there was context or a follow-up question? Does the author of the article know how to contact the guy who said it for a follow-up/clarification?      I sometimes defend Politico when it's criticized for bad journalism. But not when it's crap like this.
2016-04-13	Just watched the segment. He was answering a question from Luke Russert. Was evidently talking about unbound delegates/delegates released by Rubio and others.

2016-04-13	He'll never be President...he was never going to be President!
2016-04-13	Clinton has netted $0 for the 33 state parties which signed up to Hillary Victory Fund.      “It looks like the Clinton campaign is using the joint fundraising committee to the benefit of their presidential committee, using major donors and now lobbyist money in ways they should not.”      The hypocrisy, and the fraud from Clinton and her campaign is astounding.      https://www.washingtonpost.com/.../b8535cea-d68f-11e5...
2016-04-13	Wong Man Kit That is incorrect. You can go to the FEC and look up the Hillary Victory Fund's year end filing and look at the disbursements made by Hillary Victory Fund to State Democratic Parties.      The document you are looking for is "SCHEDULE B FILINGS FOR REPORT #FEC-1047317" and look specifically at the disbursements made for Line 22. The Hillary Victory Fund has an FEC committee ID of C00586537.      http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi.../forms/C00586537/1047317/sb/22      The Hillary Victory Fund hasn't filed its first quarter financial reports (for 2016) yet, so the numbers are only for 2015. So there's no information on money disburse to state Democratic parties in 2016 yet.
2016-04-13	Too little, too late.
2016-04-13	Right. Because the DNC doesn't deserve it.
2016-04-13	I doubt the candidates would agree. Besides, Bernie has helped the DNC in the past; I guess that doesn't count- unless one wants to use it against him.

2016-04-13	I'll be contributing to these folks along with Senator Jeff Merkley (who isn't up for re-relection this time). This is how we take our party back from Wall Street.

2016-04-13	Thank you Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley & NYC Transit Workers Union Local 100 for endorsing Bernie! New York Democratic debate April 14th in Brooklyn. Bernie was born and raised in Brooklyn.

2016-04-13	Alex Meyer we want our democraatic party back from your crone friends
2016-04-13	So Bernie isn't campaigning for current Democrats holding office, but against them. Another reason to not vote for this crazed man. He is giving the finger to our president and Democrat party. What a loser. He's just like Trump.
2016-04-13	He's ampaigning for people who will replace corrupt Democrats currently in office. They would be actual Democrats that advocate actual Democratic party ideals, not watered down Republicans who do nothing but ensure that the left is anemic and just as corporate as the right.
2016-04-13	Seth O'Bannion Since when is disagreement tantamount to corruption? Smearing seems to be the only way for Sanders and now these candidates to win. The real issue is that all of these candidates should run in different parties but want to gain the benefit of the Democratic party. How can you not see the cynicism and corruption with this thinking!
2016-04-13	Stephanie Sommer I'm not saying that they are corrupt because they disagree. I'm saying that most of the Democratic party is corrupt. Not as corrupt as the GOP, but corrupt nonetheless.

2016-04-13	they dont care about crumbling infrastructure though. the union just likes free stuff. the benefits they get are crazy.
2016-04-13	jealousy isn't very nice. If you want free stuff and benefits...go to your boss and ask for it.      What do you think he will say?      Now get everyone in your office to ask for it and if he refuses...all of you quit.      What do you think he will say then?      it's called "Negotiating Power" and that's what Unions provide. I honestly don't understand what the problem is? ...See More
2016-04-13	Adam Sinclair It's not jealousy at all. Its theft fromn taxpayers. NYC is overtaxed and this may shock sanders but the payments to his union friends for nonsense? That's part of the reason why NYC infrastructure is crumbling. Ton of revenue. But it all goes out. So you have nonsense like uniform allowances which provide more money for uniforms than people can possibly buy in uniforms.      Then there is the nearly 200 employees who work for the transit authority who make over $200,000 a year for....being a conductor. you know, punching tickets.
2016-04-13	Adam Sinclair The problem is theft from taxpayers. Being a thief yourself, you wouldn't understand.

2016-04-13	No worries, he'll just take back all the trillions of tax payer money that the wealthiest .001% are hiding in offshore accounts and tax havens. See "The Panama Papers." ;)
2016-04-13	I am sure all corporate giants will becoming out against Sanders. What did FDR tell these sycophants, I welcome your hatred. The greed of these sick unpatriotic bastards is decandent and they will not give up without a fight. Their time is coming to an end. Jeff Immelt Obama x something came out in an editorial in Oregonian against Sanders. Go Figure! The only candidate that will demand change and work for it and get more progressive and liberals in the house and senate is Bernie. Bernie is only candiate that can beat the republicons.
2016-04-13	Decandent is not a word.

2016-04-13	Somebody clearly stumbled through English classes in school.. which doesn't give me hope you that you even attended economics or macroeconomics classes. Sometimes it better to keep your mouth shut and leave people wondering if you're a fool, then to open it and remove all doubt.
2016-04-13	I guess it never occurred to libtards to look at the government policies that are driving these companies to do this.      Thinking is obviously not a strong suit of Bernie and his faithful acolytes

2016-04-13	One of the reasons I support Trump is in the hopes that Americans become more privy to the corruption we have. When party activists in Colorado can choose delegates without any input from the voters, and those activists are establishment supporters, there is nothing that will persuade those activists to pick any delegates who support an insurgent candidate. The entire process is designed to stop insurgent candidates (which is what Trump is).      Of course, the exploiter-funded pundits who call Trump a "whiner" and a "loser" because he didn't get any of the Colorado delegates fail to mention that ...See More

Says a lot about the GOP now doesn't it

Why did he vote No against the bank/auto bailout. Why did he vote No on the best immigration bill ever?

2016-04-13	Lynne Webley you are a deluded fool.
2016-04-13	I doubt these endorsements make a difference anyway.
2016-04-13	If Sanders had gotten you would be cheering
2016-04-13	Lynne Webley Ain't that the god damn truth.

2016-04-13	At this point endorsements dont matter very much anymore. She has so many endorsements that Sanders could win the rest and still be way behind in total membership.      Pledged Delegates matter. By April 26th the race is going to be too far fetched for Sanders to continue but he will anyways. Why give up all the attention and money hes soaking
2016-04-13	lol what fucking money? The money he is spending on his campaign?
2016-04-13	Mike Steere Yeah, that's what he means. Too many words for ya?
2016-04-13	Mike Steere the money his fat cat wifey Jane sanders is funneling to their private accounts. Release the tax returns where are the tax returns Bernie sanders? http://www.vanityfair.com/.../01/bernie-sanders-family-money via @VanityFair
2016-04-13	very informative website!!!!...made by a self-avowed socialist...it's not big, but it's the video that plays in the background that just goes on&on detailing hillary's lies and flip-flops over many years...if you watch just a little of it and can still vote for hillary...you have no integrity and less than no self respect..   to the maker, i say: very good job...and all verifiable via google      Under no circumstances will I vote for Hillary Clinton. (says the website creator)   TheDNCand Clinton machine are using the same dirty tricks they used in 2008.   Sign this pledge and send a message to the establishment that Democracy   is not a plaything for the elite.      http://wontvotehillary.com/

2016-04-13	So, you think anyone is really going to watch your propaganda? And where do all you self-serving single-issue vapid white progressives get you moral high ground? I mean the most self-serving group I've seen ever in politics. progressive bull shit. Totalitarians.
2016-04-13	Clinton is one creepy dude.,
2016-04-13	Clinton is a brave woman: and she will make a fine President
2016-04-13	Too bad your Colorado Sheriff has no arrest authority (nor even right to carry reciprocity) in Cleveland, OH.
2016-04-13	She's bringing th sheriff just for show. If she wanted someone to protect her she would have brought a hired a trained private guard.
2016-04-13	Chauncey Banks She? Are you high?
2016-04-13	David Romer apparently, or that is the most virile lesbian, I have ever seen!
2016-04-13	tRUMP supporters - violent, stupid and brutish.
2016-04-13	The way they shut down that rally in Chicago was reminiscent of the klan. Sorry, that was demkkkrats so we should be used to the klan's tactics...
2016-04-13	Anthony Cortez The Communists. The anarchists. ALL with there flags flying proudly came in and beat people from the burbs...................Louis Guiterrez has his """people""" there. Disgusting.
2016-04-13	Anthony Cortez I was there along with my friends all who had jobs. We all took off park early and went to the rally.We kicked trumps ignorant birther racist facist piece of trash out of our city. Felt so good. You mad bro?
2016-04-13	So can we finally call conservatives 'thugs' now? I mean, they are acting just like that.
2016-04-13	This summer I hear the drumming , four dead in O-hi-o!
2016-04-13	Trumpkins aren't really conservative. At least Trump himself isn't.
2016-04-13	Daniel Warren Curtis And what to you is a "conservative"?
2016-04-13	There is a huge difference between disagreeing with someone's political views and threatening and harassing someone over thier political views. I completely disagree with almost everything that comes out of Trump's mouth-but I would never call or send an email to a supporters home.
2016-04-13	PROBABLY NO ONE IN TRUMP CAMPAIGN OR ANY SUPPORTER DID      ABOUT 99% OF THESE CLAIMS ARE DONE FOR PUBLICITY      WHEN IT IS REAL. THE FBI IS CALLED IN. TAPES ARE MADE.      WHEN IT IS A HOAX ..............JUST PEOPLE RUNNING THEIR MOUTHS.      NAME A NAME. ARREST SOMEONE. PHONES HAVE PERSONAL I.D. SO DO E-MAILS TRACK SOME OF THE GHOST PEOPLE.
2016-04-13	Sherry Wendenland When It reaches this level it ain't a hoax. And you can bet the proper authtorites DO know about this crap. And if you don't think Trump supporters are capable of this you better think again. Every group has their fanatics-and your guy can push their buttons quicker than anyone.
2016-04-13	Sherry Wendenland you are unhinged. lay off the caffeine and caps
2016-04-13	trump's tough guys will riot until thay have to change their hearing aid batteries and refill their Flomax prescriptions      They're a collection of cranky old men without the guts to throw anything beyond invective
2016-04-13	Well if you remember the death threats Scott Walker and his entire family got after taking on and defeating the unions twice in Wisconsin, oh never mind, you are in my top 5 biggest morons that post here so keep up the good work..
2016-04-13	Mike Austin - Got the 1st 4 slots locked up for yourself?
2016-04-13	The big bad bully is really starting to sound like a whiny lib, guess he's forgetting how to make the GREATEST DEALS KNOWN TO MANKIND, lol !! Typical bully, smack him in the face and he isn't near as brave.
2016-04-13	Most of us want to have good income but dont know how to do that on Internet there are a lot of methods to earn huge sum at home, but whenever Buddies try that they get trapped in a scam/fraud so I thought to share with you a genuine and guaranteed method for free to earn huge sum of money at home anyone of you interested should visit the page.

2016-04-13	He is a whiny lib.
2016-04-13	Chris Jackson . . . who seeks the nomintion of the party of whiniing.
2016-04-13	This is what the GOP brought into their group, this is what they shall receive. This is how Donald Trump discredits the process and adds another dagger in the heart of the GOP. The leaders wanted to deligitimize President Obama, well it is backfiring and the GOP is now the target.
2016-04-13	Actually Trump has not yet begun to attack the dumbocrats, from weak sister Hillary to the head thieving communist black baboon himself!
2016-04-13	Brad Smith never argue with an idiot. People watching won't be able to tell the difference.
2016-04-13	Brad Smith The GOP have been railing away at Hillary for years. And she be like, 'TURN DOWN FOR WHAT!?'
2016-04-13	Go ahead as use arcane rules to deny the rank and file their democratic right to select the delegates and watch the Republican rank and file refuse to vote for the establishment's selected candidate. Slimy Lyin' Ted Cruz can have his buddies and insider bully boys nullify the peples choice all he wants but he won't get the voters to vote for him! I stump for Trump!
2016-04-13	Trump can't win, Ted Cruz can't win. Sorry boy. (NOT)
2016-04-13	Yep Michael Kelly is right. But Brad you go ahead and stump for trump who is a lump and a crump along with his dump he is nothing more than a chump
2016-04-13	Cruz didn't make up the rules in Colorado. The GOP state chair did. Grow up and get a clue.
2016-04-13	Primaries aren't supposed to be democratic. Its the method used for the party to select its nominee and are private entities. They are free to select their candidates anyway they desire. And people are free to vote for that party or not. You get a crack at democracy in November. He knew how Colorado does their business last year and was caught flat footed and Cruz got the delegates. Even his own children cant vote for him because they didnt know the rules
2016-04-13	The majority of tRUMP supporters choose willful ignorance and playing the victim over dealing with facts and following rules. Babies gotta cry!
2016-04-13	The lowlife fans of donald are too stupid to understand the simple truth. Just like donald was so proud to say he used the "rules" of bankruptcy which were legal, Cruz used the legal rules of the Colorado primary.
2016-04-13	Brian Crowder ...Trumpanzees are the biggest pussies on the planet.   What did you expect?
2016-04-13	If you want to play the game, learn the rules.
2016-04-13	Kerry and Obama have been torturing me for years. Hey Kerry, you DUMBASS phony VietNam "hero"..ISSIS is not a country; they are thugs who must be killed and waterboarding them would be a treat for them..SCREW THEM AND YOU, YOU PUKE ASS BITCH!
2016-04-13	I assume that you served our country. Regardlesss of politics both Kerry and McCain are war heros
2016-04-13	It's always amusing to read the uninformed opinions of garden-variety idiots such as yourself.
2016-04-13	I meant the comment about serving sarcastically-our vets do not denigrate service and sacrafice
2016-04-13	Mr. Kerry, no worries, Donald Trump will never be president, but I sure hope he is the nominee of the Republican party. If so, this election will be over quicker than the Tyson-Spinks fight.

2016-04-13	Mr Kerry don't waste your time and energy responding to what Trump says.   He's a carnival barker who belongs in a circus not global politics.
2016-04-13	OBAMA IS THE CIRCUS!
2016-04-13	wow, you sound uneducated
2016-04-13	Robert Johnston what a thought provoking and deep come back. Get outt here and let the adults debate.
2016-04-13	hanoi johnny ... 24/7 sissy libby.
2016-04-13	Both the Obama admin and Congressional Dems, who held both Houses for the first 2 years of Obama's Presidency, failed to prosecute Bush and his insiders for their war crimes. They have not investigated their buddy Rahm Emanuel for the scandalous and deadly situations in Chicago, including Homan Square. As such, their credibility on torture is piss-poor. After Bill Clinton, establishment Dems have become as culpable in criminal activity as Republicans. These aren't America's leaders. They're stooges and sock-puppets for the corporations, the MIC, and Israel. Americans need to wake-up and stop being divided by the empty talk of both "parties".
2016-04-13	Anyone picking up the ball will still have to deal with fallout from the cesspool sliced open by Trump. Aside from Cruz and his ilk who bathe in that cesspool, no one wants to.
2016-04-13	Who cares?

2016-04-13	But, but, losers are "pussies" according to Trump!      Trump has told us no less, than 21,203,489,673,098,590,217,590,452,157,670,548 times, that he only hires the best!
2016-04-13	You misread it ,he said "I only hire the Beast people "

2016-04-13	Let me know when Hillary is treated in a similar fashion. Even Fox News wouldn't pull this kind of stunt and would leave her a rose petal entrance.. and a few questions about Benghazi or things people no longer care about if they have any sense.

2016-04-13	Inquisition: a period of prolonged and intensive questioning      Yes, BS was being question intensely about being the freaking president of the United States. The transcript shows what he said, and 'flavor' wouldn't make his words any less vague. And before or after what? The interview? Sanders and his supporters are on the ball during the epic speeches but can't stay focused or thoughtful when pressed for details and specifics.
2016-04-13	Inquisition: an ecclesiastical tribunal established by Pope Gregory IX circa 1232 for the suppression of heresy. It was active chiefly in northern Italy and southern France and Spain, becoming notorious for the use of torture. In 1542 the papal Inquisition was re-established to combat Jewry, eventually becoming an organ of papal government.

2016-04-13	I read the transcript and there was nothing wrong with his answers. The problem is the spin. To give just one example, he said one way to break up the banks would be to use Todd-Frank. If you go back and look at the January debate, you will find Clinton saying exactly that. Now she is running around attacking him for saying what she herself said. Really this goes beyond spin. It's just distortion and misinformation.

2016-04-13	More of the "Get things done" bs. She's a loser.
2016-04-13	Hillary is brilliant. Sanders is still operating out of the leftwing playbook that he learned in the 1960's when women who wanted to be involved in leftwing politics were treated by the men in the movement as things on which to slake their sexual appetites and make sandwiches.      I used to respect him and I believed the purity hype. Since he began to run for president I have lost most of my respect for him. He's neither as pure nor as smart as I thought he was.
2016-04-13	Susan Lowe Tonight at his New York rally, Sandwrs was introduced by a supporter who called Hillary a Democrat Corporate Whore. Sanders is toast.
2016-04-13	Henry Acosta And Hillary Clinton is facing possible indictment for corruption - she's toastier
2016-04-13	I have only one issue with Emilys List. I fundamentally disagree that the gender of a candidate should have any impact on a choice to elect the person. I recall Barbara McClintock, the famous geneticist who inspired thousands of women scientists. She was going to be presented an award for her contributions to science and when she went to the award ceremony, she was informed that she was being recognized for being a great woman scientist, not a great scientist (which she absolutely was, her work on transposable elements was revolutionary (for anyone who cares... "jumping genes").) She left the conference and declined the award because she refused to accept the recognition conditioned on being a woman. You know what? I think she was absolutely right. She was a phenomenal scientist regardless of what her genitals looked like.      I think politicians should follow her example.
2016-04-13	If you have a problem with a person getting elected just because of their gender, then you should understand the purpose of Emily's List. The absolute barrier that kept qualified women out but allowed inept men in has been removed. But, the systemic series of biases that make endorsement and election much easier for men remains. What has brought some progress are efforts undertaken with great intentionality to overcome those barriers and enable female an opportunity to make their case. Male privilege allows us to not recognize those barriers exist if it feels politically inconvenient to do so.
2016-04-13	@Bryan Davis, Bernie also has his rules he only help Democrats who pass his purity test or as he they have to support him. While Emilys List is about supporting women and no they don't have to pass a purity test.
2016-04-13	Philip E Clarkson Jr I remember hearing Mark Sheilds once say that, eventually, every political campaign begins looking either for converts or heretics. The Sanders campaign and its supporters are forever excusing Bernie's lapses in purity, while constantly verging on labelling those that deviate from them in the smallest measure as enemies of the people who will be driven out in the forthcoming purge.
2016-04-13	Bernie is a phony and definitely NOT A DEMOCRAT!!
2016-04-13	That's because the democratic party has been taken over by the center-right. It's time for progressives to take it back. We're not living in the Reagan era anymore.
2016-04-13	Grant Mayland Not a democrat = huge compliment.

Don't expect this to go away any time soon....
2016-04-13	Well, when one considers that the democrat party is just as messed up with their superdelegates, then at that point it seems silly to suggest that this is merely a "teabagger" complaint. In fact, Trump acknowledged that he is doing well in delegates, but that he still thinks the process is extremely flawed, and he is correct. It really doesn't matter which side of the political aisle one sits - they are both problematic and both deny the people a say in their primary selection.

2016-04-13	With Debbie Wasserman Schultz and her fellow Clintonite hacks running the DNC, how could poor Bernie not have gotten a fair shake?      After all, 31 superdelegates endorsed him and only infinity+1 have gone for Hillary.
2016-04-13	Hugh Johnson I see you're a desperate Hillary hack spamming the comments section. Anyhow, not that you deserve a response but yes, 15% of the delegates not even being elected means they're 30% of what you need for a majority and the nomination, and that's absurdly undemocratic.      As to popular vote, that's irrelevant because different states have different types of contests - caucuses vs. closed primaries vs. open primaries and some states (like Iowa) don't even bother reporting real vote totals. It's a totally made-up number that discounts Bernie's wins in caucus states.
2016-04-13	And correct me if I'm wrong but Bernie Sanders was well aware of the rules by which the Democractic Party regulates its primaries, caucuses, and convention. Bernie set out a whole strategy based on swamping caucus states with young supporters and they were successful it's just that Clinton's strategy of going big in the Primary states and limiting Bernie from runaway wins in the caucus states was more effective.      Losers always complain about the rules once they know they've lost.
2016-04-13	Wayne Anderson If Hillary wins New York and Pennsylvania and California, I'll legitimately accept she won. If she loses 2 or more of those and relies on superdelegates for the nod, no, I wouldn't say she won fair and square.
2016-04-13	I doubt if I will be the only one who will vote for Trump over Clinton. I don't like Trump -- but I don't like Hillary any more than I like Trump. And I honestly do not believe he will govern worse than she will. Hillary is saying what she thinks she needs to to win -- if she does win, she will drop the middle class like a hot potato and go back to her bffs on Wall Street. We may suffer under Trump, but we will not suffer MORE under Trump than we will suffer under Clinton. The Democrats sell us out because they think we've got nowhere else to go. This needs to end.
2016-04-13	You are going to look foolish watching Sanders endorse and then campaign for Clinton while you supposedly 'vote' for Trump.
2016-04-13	Trump is maybe the only candidate the Republicans could put up that I *wouldn't* vote for instead of Hillary.      Hillary is a liar, a grifter, a career politician surrounded by a whole ecosystem of corrupt Clintonite chiselers, but at least she's not a threat to the Republic.
2016-04-13	So you're either not a democrat or just a whiner who will pick up his toys and go home. I sure hope you or the people you know and care about aren't LGBT, women, or immigrants then.
2016-04-13	Convential Wisdom is always conventional and seldom wise. Progressive voices get short shrift. Progressives were right about the Iraq war, for example, yet what we see on TV are the pundits that were wrong about it. And there are many other examples.
2016-04-13	Well, 74% of the public were for removing Hussein from power, so I guess they were all wrong too. Perhaps now you can put up all the things Progressives were wrong about instead of cherry pick a vote from when 4/5ths of the current Sanders voter base was under 10 years old?

2016-04-13	Agreed. Further, notice how the GOP is NOT attacking Bernie (who has been given a free pass and his policies have NOT been thoroughly vetted), but the GOP is constantly attacking Hillary because they KNOW she is formidable, more qualified than any of the presidential nominees, and would have a much better chance to beat any of the GOP presidential nominees.

However, if he thought the rules were unfair he should have sought to change them BEFORE the primaries, not demand that two innings be added to the game when you're down in the 8th

2016-04-13	The "hack" is strong with this one....
2016-04-13	Nice try Sean.
2016-04-13	I listen to Sean "I'm not a Republican" Hannity on my way home from work every day. He's been sounding a bit, shall we say, concerned about conservative chances. Who can blame him?
2016-04-13	Hannity may be telling the "truth" when he says he is not a Republican. He is, in fact, a wizard of the KKK white supremist group.
2016-04-13	I tried listening to him but while that "wrap your head in duct tape cause rightwingers brains explode" was a bit weird his "wrap your parakeet in duct tape so it doesn't explode during intercourse" was just too much.
2016-04-13	Sean      Sean hannity has been fair to all the candidates. they are mad because he is fair to Trump and dose not tear him down like mygen kelly dose. hang in there Sean

2016-04-13	I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with the gentleman.
2016-04-13	America needs Kasich! BOTH candidates TC and DT are unqualified & inexperienced. John Kasich who has run a positive campaign on ISSUES ONLY, is incredibly qualified. Look at his experience in National Security, Foreign Affairs, budget committee, and his record of successful governing as CEO of Ohio! John Kasich is not only qualified and experienced, he is electable! #kasichCan beat the democrats in Nov! #kasich4wisconsin #kasich4PA Kasich4NY #kasich4NJ #kasich4California
2016-04-13	Unfortunately, his issues are still the same old failed conservative ideas warmed over for the 9th time.
2016-04-13	Kasich should at least quit trying to explain Old Testament history to Jewish students.
2016-04-13	Won't win either...
2016-04-13	Jesus little marco has only been out of the running for a few weeks and they are already trying to cross swords

2016-04-13	Glen Corona Rubio is the one now endorsing Ted Cruz.
2016-04-13	Cruz/Rubio would demolish Clinton. I hope they do it.
2016-04-13	oh right two anti women Cubians will never make it to the white house.
2016-04-13	Hilarious.   The only sensible running mate for Ted Cruzifix is Satan.
2016-04-13	Lisa Smith By anti-woman I take it you mean those of us who think it is not ok to dismember little boys and girls in the womb, right? Just making sure your euphemistic use of language actually is understandable.
2016-04-13	Right Marco couldn't even win his own state in the primary and BTW Cruz Americans are not sending you to the white house we are sending you back to Canida. No one likes you.
2016-04-13	Where's Canida?
2016-04-13	I refuse to believe Heidi Cruz's favorite movie is "Legally Blonde"
2016-04-13	Only because she hasn't seen "16 candles."
2016-04-13	She could have said, "Pretty Woman".
2016-04-13	Did you catch the part where he forgot Joe Paterno died? Also why would he think pandering to Paterno in Pittsburg would be a good idea? It made him look super out of touch.
2016-04-13	There's a reason he looks out of touch - he is out of touch.
2016-04-13	And "JOPA," as the late Penn State University football coach was called is not a hero in Western Pennsylvania for two major reasons: he likely shielded from exposure and initial prosecution, Mike Sandusky, a long time child molester who served for years on JOPA's senior coaching staff. Paterno did little when that fact was brought to his attention--kicking "upstairs"--but claiming he did all that he could.      JOPA also abandoned a long time football rivalry with Penn State and the University of Pittsburgh when JOPA took his school to the Big 10 and refused to meet Pitt in games.      That rivalry/series partially has been restored and will begin anew next year, I believe, but it took Paterno's death to make that happen again..      So JOPA is a no-no in Western Pa. and Trump didn't help himself praising a fallen and tainted idol.
2016-04-13	This reaffirms my belief that Trump suffers from a bad case of Bumper Sticker Tourette Syndrome... In this case is bumper stickers from the 70's, he just spews out any 7 word slogan his brain thinks of
2016-04-13	When Trump is president, guess what, you're going to need that steel to build more airports for all those flying pigs.
2016-04-13	Trump is going to be president because Sanders is going to divide the Left Wing Vote and Trump will walk into the presidency.
2016-04-13	Dustin Arseneault If Sanders is forced out at the Convention despite catching HRC in pledged delegates, I'm guessing he'll jump on the Green ticket & announce Tulsi Gabbard as his running mate (politely offering Jill Stein a cabinet position). Whether or not Bernie could win is up for debate, but I'd say you're right that the most likely outcome is this would make it somewhat easier for Trump to potentially win. And I think there's millions of Americans out there who figure there's no way he could be worse than 4-8 yrs of the Clintons.

2016-04-13	China will soon have around 400 million tons of excess steel capacity annually. Guess what that does to steel prices. US Steel couldn't compete with that. Same issue in China for coal. China is slowing rapidly, but the state controls heavy industry for social employment reasons, so those plants are going to keep running as long as China can continue to manufacture the credit needed to fund them. As an example, a state-owned shipping company just ordered 11 of the largest container ships in the world to be built at a time when shipping rates are the lowest in history. What that does is keep the...See More
2016-04-13	Max Corder There is always one magical way to jump ahead of China, and massively increase the price and demand of steel. War... However, the entire world appears to be heading towards that anyway, so what would the difference be anyway?
2016-04-13	Max Corder China's building products are all inferior to ours.

2016-04-13	Joe Conder ... and your lungs cough up blood.
2016-04-13	Suffers from the irrepairable, disqualifying defect of being Trump....That's going to leave a mark.
2016-04-13	Gary, Trump was never intended to be a Republican presidential nominee. He was the perfect 'sucker punch', particularly with no brains & lots of folding stuff. The Republican party saved heaps of money, whilst giving the party plenty of time to weigh up their realistic options. They also didn't have to destroy Trump's credibility, which he happily managed all by himself. Even staunch Republican supporters are queueing up in freezing cold wet conditions, to cast their vote in an effort to end Trump's nomination threat. One word totally sums up Democratic electioneering -TRUMP. What else needs to be said, given he has managed to alienate African Americans, Hispanics, Mexicans, his own party, US allies, the LGBT community, the UN, & the rest of the world, with the exception of Putin & the Chinese. Congratulations!

2016-04-13	But um, absolutely zero Republicans take the Daily News seriously.      In fact this might actually help Cruz...      If the WSJ or the CBN denounced Cruz in these terms, maybe it'd move votes in New York and upstate. But as it is, I doubt it.

2016-04-14	Kasich or Rubio or any moderate Republican would beat Hillary like a drum.      The problem is there is absolutely zero appetite for a moderate in the Republican party.      And on the Democratic side, I guess Hillary has decided to pretend to be a black socialist to win the nomination. Who knows what she really is. You can never tell with Clintons what you're likely to end up with, except a horde of Clintonite grifters feeding off the public trough. It'll be gross I predict, since she has a lot less energy to restrain them than Bill had in the 90s.
2016-04-14	Carl Rove? Is he still around? After the meltdown on FOX News during the last Presidential elections? Is he still trying to make a name for himself other than turd blossom? That fits him just fine.

2016-04-14	Russ Gallegher you believe mostly bullshit
2016-04-14	Trump can win what? The nomination? Sure.      But even my elderly moderate mother that recognizes Hillary is a lying b- says Trump is the only politician that's ever frightened her before in nearly 70 years of American democracy.      Um no, Trump isn't winning anything besides Miss Congeniality on his way out the door to one of his beauty pageant harlequins.
2016-04-14	It is always hard to argue with "I've got an Uncle in Buffalo" arguments.      Ask yourself, "Why is the Republican Establishment" afraid of Trump? There have been outlandish candidates in every election.      The Establishment fears Trump because      1. Immigration Reform (both illegal and H1B)   2. International Trade Reform      The Establishment is now trying to make a deal with Trump to blunt those two policy positions. If Trump agrees, then Rove and company will help him.
2016-04-14	Brian Bradshaw I think they are scared because they have very serious doubts that he can win in the general election. I've got no big issue with the guy, but I don't see any sliver of a chance for him to win. I hope I am wrong but no shred of factual evidence or data I've found says otherwise.
2016-04-14	Brian Bradshaw the establishment fears Trump because they know the GOP will lose the presidency when every woman, and every father with a daughter will not vote for a guy who says "Woman, you have to treat 'em like sh$t"
2016-04-14	Can't help but wonder how much $$$ Rove gets from his "backed superpac".
2016-04-14	I would imagine the same or more as all the super pacs on both sides..
2016-04-14	He makes a very good living telling others who to give money too. You would think people would learn after 2012 but you just can't fix stupid.
2016-04-14	Dwight Rollins you're very correct on that! Just another Republican TELLING Americans what to think because he knows best...just like Colorado. Well that worked out really well for them in 2012, didn't it. And they still don't get it and why people are supporting Trump!!!

2016-04-14	Giaime Porcu trghto gamey porker. I am sure you prefer Marxists.
2016-04-14	Hillary will once again get slaughtered and embarrased in the debate, and afterwards the media will once again pronounce her as the clear winner.
2016-04-14	Not only will the media pronounce her the winner, but they'll say mathematically it's more likely the Clinton Foundation is something other than a massive money laundering bribery scandal than it is that Hillary can ever be beaten.      After all, even if she wins 15% of the vote from here on out she'll win 117% of the vote from grifters and sycophants.
2016-04-14	I only hope CNN hasn't given her pre-scripted questions... She can't do a thing without aides and memory stuff... I hope if jornalists are harsh on Sanders that he fires them back and Clinton with questions, too. I hope Bernie starts to questions them all in order to show how ill-informed and unprepared most jornalists and Clinton are.
2016-04-14	Jonathan Gelling Keep dreaming. Sanders two days ago hired an anti-Zionist Jew who supports boycotting Israel -- explaining that she was his "Jewish outreach" campaign person -- later that day, 12 liberal Jewish members of the New York City Council jointly endorsed Clinton.      New York is going to hand Bernie Sanders his verkakte tuchus on a Nathan's hot dog bun with pickled relish going up his butt crack. #FeelTheLoss      And, seeing as Latino voters in New York overwhelmingly favor Clinton, let's also tell Bernie the deranged pickpocket #AdiosYBuenViaje.

2016-04-14	Wajid Ali ... I checked it out.. YOU ARE A SCAM!
2016-04-14	Frank Kozel III it was never a real person. It is software that searches for open comment sections. A bot. Not a person.
2016-04-14	I hope he points out that she's a lying bitch.      To do so, he'll only have to let her actually talk about her black, New Yorker roots.
2016-04-14	If she were a man you wouldn't call her bitch.
2016-04-14	Senator Clinton has done a LOT more for New York State than Sanders.      She was one of our Senators on 9/11 and helped immensely in the aftermath, getting money for survivors and first responders, et cetera.
2016-04-14	Javier Rod Nu Sexist remark. I call men "bitches" all the time.      Care for a demonstration?
2016-04-14	Wonder if he'll bring up the speeches again, she got paid 3 million for and won't release transcripts of until the Republicans do (so as not to be at a disadvantage, which only makes sense if she said something that people don't want to hear.)
2016-04-14	Wonder if she will bring up the tax returns he is hiding.
2016-04-14	Women for Bernie Sanders 2016 shared --   27k+ turned out tonight to Bernie Sanders' rally at Washington Square Park. Ground zero for the revolution, Bern'ers! Bernie Sanders AMAZING Speech at Washington Square Park New York Rally (4-13-16) https://youtu.be/0SJGK1j-x2Q      JayZ fans for Bernie Sanders -- Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City   & we are fans of Jimmy Kimmel & JayZ! Enjoy - Jay Z Performs "Empire State of Mind" in Brooklyn https://youtu.be/qooJO1JjkUw      Your invite for the Democratic debate tonight --   Thank you NYC Transit Workers Union Local 100 for endorsing Bernie! New York Democratic debate April 14th in Brooklyn. Bernie was born and raised in Brooklyn. Welcome home Bernie!
2016-04-14	Jesse Cooday If you look at pictures from that rally, you'll see it proves that Sanders is going to lose New York big time.      Normally near Washington Square Park at any given time you see New Yorkers of all races, ages, genders, et cetera.      All you see in the photos are whites. Here and there, one black person, one Asian. It is HARD to get such a nearly all-white crowd in that neighborhood, and the fact that the Sanders rally was overwhelmingly populated with whites shows you that Sanders does not have deep and broad support in New York City.      Adios y buen viaje.
2016-04-14	Enogh of this old woman. She needs to retire and forget her war on the male. Help her poor daughter raise her childen and, like General MacArthur, just fade away.

2016-04-14	Ian Blake "single wide"?? do you know there are more "singlewides" in CA than anywhere else, Ian?
2016-04-14	Nixon? Coming from the republicans? No thanks i dont need lectures of morals. I will vote whoever is the democratic nominee.
2016-04-14	The similarities are striking. Both are paranoid. They both dislike the common man. Both are so paranoid that secrecy is paramount. Both violated congressional subpoenas -- Nixon by "losing" 18 minutes on a tape, and Clinton by refusing to turn over ALL her emails - including PORTIONS OF 6 from Sid Blumenthal (marked CONFIDENTIAL) that talked about Benghazi and another five months worth - plus the ones she deleted after the subpoena -- and she still hasn't turned them over after a court order by TWO different federal judges heariing two different civil cases that are about to turn crimina...See More
2016-04-14	Gail Newman, don't quit your day job. You suck at psychoanalysis.
2016-04-14	Jilli Brown It is obvious this ad is so right on that immediate disparaging remarks and name calling are immediately needed by the zealot Pro Clinton fringe groups to try to make the obvious and honest comparison seem so untrue. I wonder what names I'll be called? Facts still are facts whether you like them or not.
2016-04-14	Poor GOP eejit Party, still feeling the sting from Hillz left foot print after that 11 hour hostile committee hearing.....Blaaaaaah
2016-04-14	It's terribly, awfully, and horribly unfair... to Nixon... to compare him to this old hag.      Nixon was a bright self-made man. Hillary is a dim-witted hanger-on who's surrounded by the sleaziest group of grifters in modern politics.      I can't remotely see how she could even polish Nixon's boots.
2016-04-14	And the GOP revisionism project is complete.
2016-04-14	Michael Eisenberg Yea, they omitted the fact that Hillary served on the Watergate Committee - do the Repubicans really want to go here?
2016-04-14	More rat fucking from the GOP. They really don't want Hillary as the nominee.
2016-04-14	Wow, astute.

2016-04-14	I don't like Greta, but she is right. This woman has a history of this sort of lawsuit. That will be thefirst thing the defense will put forth.

2016-04-14	Hank Marcus which is why you won't be
2016-04-14	when she opens her mouth all I hear is "waaaaahhhhh!"
2016-04-14	^talking about Greta ?
2016-04-14	Rob Barton do you watch Greta, she is fact based and logical.
2016-04-14	Mark Zinan no the fuck she is not lol.
2016-04-14	Well Greta is a shill for sure. No one on FOX gave the infamous Sarah Palin more air time without ever challenging her crazy, baffling, and unhinged rants. No one other than Greta (aka Hatchet Face). She's done the same with Trump and his entire family.
2016-04-14	She was better when she was on New England Cable News and not trying to throw political opinions into the mix.
2016-04-14	Name caller.
2016-04-14	Mike DiGiacomo She was never a journalist really, but she was much better on CNN before Ailes got her into his laboratory and turned her into one of his Foxbots. If you look really close, you can see the small bolts on the side of her neck.
2016-04-14	How very condescending of Van Susteren. What business of hers is it whether or not Fields decides to continue with a civil suit?
2016-04-14	Van Susteren is a lawyer with much more experience in journalism. It's fine if Fields does not want to take advice. But Fields is destroying her own career with her childish behavior.
2016-04-14	Some people do a little bit here and there to try to help fools and sluts keep from making greater light of themselves.
2016-04-14	She has a tv show that renders opinions and news specifically about politics so it is the core of her business.
2016-04-14	I'm with Greta. Michelle Fields got her minute of fame. Now shw wants to sue for defamation. When it is all said and done, she might want to find a new career field because employement for her in the media will be limited.
2016-04-14	An employer shakes her hand when she comes in for an interview...
2016-04-14	Larry Kelly I smell a lawsuit.
2016-04-14	I am absolutely not a Trump supporter or a Fox News supporter, but when this woman calls a journalist a shill for basically agreeing with every legal analyst and the Florida prosecutors, you know she is batshit crazy.
2016-04-14	Sanders should disavow the highly offensive way a very accurate comment was stated. Hillary Clinton is a highly paid service provider to Wall Street.      Paul Song immediately apologized: "I am very sorry for using the term [w____] to refer to some in congress who are beholden to corporations and not us. It was insensitive,"

2016-04-14	Ian Blake Yes, Sure., the woman who got the health care crisis on the US map, and into discussion, and almost got the first national bill passed suddenly doesn't care about Americans having health care. Bernie is gettign desperate.
2016-04-14	Ian Blake You cannot discern truth.
2016-04-14	Yeah, it was insensitive to whores, who make an honest living, unlike politicians who are bought by corporations.
2016-04-14	who did you vote for in the most recent local election?
2016-04-14	I hope you weren't talking about Life time politician Sanders
2016-04-14	Shut up soc.
2016-04-14	Not only was the comment offensive, but it showed that the speaker had no idea wtf he was talking about.
2016-04-14	Her services and votes are bought and paid for. How does he not know what he was talking about? Sounds like a whore.
2016-04-14	William L Miller Cany you, or anyone, supply one example of how a campaign contribution influenced her vote in the Senate - beyond, of coure, representing her constituents.
2016-04-14	Leo T. Ward oh really? did you ask BS for his evidence when he claim all other politicians are bought?
2016-04-14	Bernie has a lot of grandiose ideas and that's a big problem..........Unless the Dems win back the House and Senate like Prez Obama enjoyed in his first two years...It's all talk!!!      Legislation isn’t passed by a single person, which is why Clinton is raising money for congressional races like presidential candidates are supposed to do: to help take congress and hopefully avoid some of the gridlock we’ve been dealing with.      Sanders hasn’t done much of anything as a career politician. His image as the new, outsider, and only honest man in the game is a marvel of modern marketing, and little more. He hasn’t introduced major legislation. Primarily because he’s unable to work with his fellow senators and that's what makes Bernie a terrible choice for president.
2016-04-14	Hillary has a few baby step ideas..........BUT unless the Dems win back the House and Senate like Prez Obama enjoyed in his first two years...It's all talk!!!      I'll swing for the fences with Bernie rather than settle for a single with Hillary.
2016-04-14	Nonsense. He's been involved in plenty of legislation but as is his humble way, he has let others take the credit. He has no need to demand that he be named as the author of any particular legislation because he has no need to feed his ego. He'll negotiate where he can with whoever he can while never losing his goal of making America a fair and equitable society.
2016-04-14	Adam Sinclair typical. You want to change the world every four years. If you berni bots want to change the world get off your ass and vote in the congressional elections! Those Bernie fans stayed home in Colorado last cycle and we lost a senior democratic senator to a junior tea bag. And we got a right wing school board! Where were the minions then? Unless we take the house and senate the gridlock will not change!
2016-04-14	I think the largest reason that Bernie has not moved the African american vote to the same extent that Hillary has is that she has done a better job of courting social leaders within that community. I think if AA voters relied less on that and more on their own research, they would be more supportive of Bernie than they currently are.      But that is not the world that we live in and sadly, AA voters respond more to issues that have AA in the title and less to issues that, while higher impact on them, are less targeted specifically to them. Optics matter as much as black lives in politics.      sad but true.
2016-04-14	Also, Sandes has spread above Clinton in younger Black and Latinos. This is one more distorted fact, Sanders also is calling for a large frange of AA.
2016-04-14	Disqah Apax I do not know that is true. I know I have met a number of Sanders supporters from just about every segment of society. The overall proven (not polled) numbers to date do not lie though. I would be curious to see if there has been movement on the numbers in southern states since they have voted though. I don't think anyone is paying attention to them, or cares (sadly) about them anymore. Now that they are done being pandered to, and since everyone knows those states will vote republican anyway, i doubt that any of the social issues of that geographic region get seen to. If Bernie gets the nomination there is a chance that at least the economic issues of that region will be seen to.
2016-04-14	you are wrong, they know of him and his policies, some don't believe they are possible,some love hillary and some do not like him for his critique of Obama, these groups make up 2/3rds of AA primary voter their was nothing Bernie could have said or done to earn their support. But cute story on what is bestfor black lives.

2016-04-14	It's leaders like Sharpton who helps to paint AA liek silly sheeps, uncultived and ill-informed voters. Clintonhas huuuuge participation of AA in the churches she is cruising, with her bullets and faith talk, making them cry like it was a reality show contest of who's crying the most. Sharpton is a shame of the AA community, siding the establishment and imprisioning the right of ppl freely think for themselves! Everyone knows how imvolved Sanders always has consistently been against any kind of segregacionism. his record speaks out loud!      "AA wake up, vote Sanders"!
2016-04-14	ummmmm I'm going to need to back the fuck up on telling us who to vote for, we are not your children and can vote for whomever we please, I would suggest you travel to the republican party and tell your fellow white men to wake up.
2016-04-14	Nah we good. We not delusional we can smell bs a mile away.
2016-04-14	No, everybody does NOT know how involved Sanders has been. As a matter of fact, it's just the opposite. Where has Bernie been on Black issues since the 1960s? He's is a statewide leader in Vermont. Why hasn't he said or done anything about all the Black people locked up in his state?      http://www.thedailybeast.com/.../vermont-s-black-leaders...
2016-04-14	I'm sure this has nothing to do with Bernie Sanders being Jewish (trumpets the elephant in the room).
2016-04-14	yeah that's it we are all bigots o.0
2016-04-14	It is more like, who is this dude? Has he ever been around here? LOL
2016-04-14	Or just we can't stand listening one more minute to another angry old white man spouting off.

2016-04-14	Now that the press has thrown their full support with the Group Never Trump because they realized they were apart of creating him. How popular is the candidate that they are promoting now Ted Cruz ? Politico does a popularity contest about Trump. NBC shows Ted Cruz's children and fawns all over them and says they are so cute. Then it's like now on every channel a Never Trump member is on TV. promoting their cause. Enough controlling the message. Do your job and be what you were educated to do. Be journalists.
2016-04-14	Hitler too loved children and in the newsreels of the time he always had them around for public events. The juxtaposition of the two is very telling in that they soften the hard image of the politician which is why they also kiss babies.

2016-04-14	Connecticut Women for Bernie Sanders shared --   "In two districts once believed to be Hillary Clinton strongholds, the state senators from Harlem and Queens — Bill Perkins and James Sanders Jr. — will endorse Bernie Sanders instead..."   "When local New York politicians like Perkins and James Sanders make the plunge, it may loosen the lid on the jar for others who are a bit nervous about making the plunge."      KING: Senators in Harlem, Queens support Sanders — EXCLUSIVE   SHAUN KING NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   http://m.nydailynews.com/.../king-senators-harlem-queens...   #berniesanders2016 #feelthebern
2016-04-14	Jesse Cooday The state senators can support who they want-that don't always mean THE VOTERS will follow. Some will...the question will it be enough.
2016-04-14	Jesse Cooday That is a really, really old story.
2016-04-14	Old Sweet Jane looks like she's got the munchies, huh? All while Bernie is distorting his lips over his lower dentures. That's ok B.S. Bernie, we already knew you never took care of your teeth, never exercise, or never did anything with your mind except trip. Heck, I haven't heard you say a well formed sentence yet. You must have some real sharp supporters, lol: Republicans and early release felony convicts starting trouble at other campaigns, Way to go B.S. Bernie - you have NO honor or integrity :(
2016-04-14	And it's Bernie supporters that are sexist and classless...
2016-04-14	wow, that was the most classless juvenile post i have seen in awhile. trump voter? jesus dude, get a grip and act like a human
2016-04-14	Jan Andrew Kuznik at least you admit it...
2016-04-14	And here i thought Bernie Sanders was delusional, the wife runs away with the title. They are a perfect match. Now go and ride the unicorn over the rainbow. Us democratic whores got voting to do and it won't be for you Sanders.
2016-04-14	Her wife run a private college into the ground, as if there is anybody in that family can handle the massive economy of USA.
2016-04-14	Chris Levin I thought she did the family taxes..uh oh.
2016-04-14	the classy new yorker has spoken. ech, thats why we dont care for new yorkers, comments like yours
2016-04-14	Is Jane laughing at B.S. Bernie's crooked spine while he is looking for something to hold him up? He's going to FALLLL while he is preoccupied at stretching his lips over his lower dentures. You are worried about the wrong thing B.S. Bernie. We all know you are a joke :) Old B.S. Bernie looks like he is making poo poo sounds with his lips to attract attention. Smooth move B.S. Bernie! Jane seems to like it anyway.
2016-04-14	Ytap Gaspar Jaimes So do the 30,000 that showed up last night to hear him speak. Then there was Hillary across town with 1200 people.
2016-04-14	Dan Foreman He does great at speeches. Too bad she has far more people actually voting for her. They don't award delegates based on the size of your crowds.
2016-04-14	David Swanner Or votes. And BTW, Jane? Get a decent haircut.
2016-04-14	A protesrt march on Friday... Now that is interesting.
2016-04-14	Put a sock in it loser.
2016-04-14	But he won't tell lthen not to be violent. Their violence is undestandable. This is an unspoken affirmation that it's ok to use physical violence and verbal assaults and threats. Why doesn't law enforcement hand him the bill for what it's going to cost taxpayers to secure the convention this summer.      How about violently overthrowing the government? Would that be good? millions of people killed and injured -how about that? then vultures, street dogs and gangs can move in and scoop up the leftovers. There will be a few very sad millionaire CEOs hanging around too, wishing the militias hadn't destroyed their property - and oh dear, they burnt down the stock exchange...      courtesy of a divisive irresponsible electorate and their leaders, with Donald Trump the guy who threw the lit match
2016-04-14	'I'm not at war'      That's code for 'I think my henchmen have things under control'

2016-04-14	i heard a good point made yesterday about this, trump has 37% of the votes and 42% of the delegates
2016-04-14	In other news, he will also not be meeting with visiters from other planets, me, my neighbor, the guy from that 70's show, etc etc.      Why is a non-event news worthy?
2016-04-14	If he had not bragged he was going to meet the Pope then this would not be a story; it would not have even made the back page had he just said he'd be speaking at a conference at a Vatican conference. And even then only for 10 minutes on a coffee break. His mistake was trying to pander to Catholics by playing up the importance of the event.
2016-04-14	Mark Keeler I guess. I kinda figured that part of it was all well travelled in the other article though.
2016-04-14	because Teh Berne made it one last friday by lying he was not invited to visit the Pope why is that difficult for you ugh
2016-04-14	Sanders lied. No other way to say it. Tried to pander to get Catholic votes. But it has bitten him. No Pope Invitation. No meeting with the Pope. All lies. Just like the one that says he and JANE have released all their income taxes. Lies. He never will - too much there to hide. Oh, his campaign has received almsot $300,000 from WALL STREET. Did he return the money? NO! (per MSNBC today). I guess it is perfectly acceptable for him to get Wall Street money, but not Hillary Clinton. Hypocrite???
2016-04-14	Good luck with voting for your beloved queen and 15% approval rated congress. Let the kids suffer for your lack of courage and unwillingness to address the ills of our country. It doesn't matter to you anymore.
2016-04-14	Rob Kadijevic if we want to do something to help the ills of the country, then vote the elitist out and the ones that "just say no".
2016-04-14	Rob Kadijevic Why bother trying to deflect from the issue? Sanders lied, end of story.
2016-04-14	That was a bad gaffe on the part of Sanders. I'm sure they are trying hard to get a meeting with the Pope, but that would really end up looking desperate and political...especially since Sanders lied in the first place.
2016-04-14	what gaffe?
2016-04-14	Adam Sinclair He lied about meeting the Pope, that is quite the gaffe.
2016-04-14	Adam Sinclair ... the gaffe where sanders implied that the pope had invited him ..... he didn't say it outright, but did get some pinochios for the implication ...
2016-04-14	Somebody need to give the old man a drink, he is desperate and grasping for straws.
2016-04-14	Well, Trump can afford the best. No one needs to give him anything.
2016-04-14	are those drinking straws for the drink he needs?

2016-04-14	Kasich always says he is surging in the polls and he is not. He always sees things about himself that no one ever sees themselves. Tells you should take what Governor Kasich says with a grain of salt.
2016-04-14	Neil - National general election polls are what Kasich sees and out of the 5 remaining candidates he is the only one with a clear path to the White House in the general election as he beats both Hillary and Sanders. With an open conevtion on the horizon why would Kasich get out at this point?
2016-04-14	Todd Smith with all due repsect compared to the other candidates you are absolutely right. He appears on paper to be the sane one. However, I have experienced Governor Kasich and he is about as moderate as Castro in Cuba is conservative. Because he will not get the nomination not by winning one state his own. He needed to be in it from the very beginning not pick and choose where he wanted to run. If he is selected by the delgates in Cleveland, the groundwork has already been set that the convention is rigged. There would be a lot of alienated voters out there on the Republican side and at that point no one has a clear path. I do not believe he will make it by running in third out of 3 positions.
2016-04-14	Todd Smith Past polls have said the same thing about Carson, Cruz, Rubio, and Trump. Once a clown car member reaches this point, their pasts catch up with them and they go straight to hell in a basket.
2016-04-14	Tiresome.
2016-04-14	I hope the GOP runs this regional turd. Once his background becomes common knowledge, he will no longer be the clown car's flavor of the month.
2016-04-14	Kasich might as well stay in now if he can afford it. If he drops out his votes will probably go to Trump anyway.
2016-04-14	Trump disqualified himself as no other with his idiotic dabbling into nuclear weapons policy. He doesn't understand international issues, he comes from a myopic view of the world with himself in the center. Suggesting that nuclear proliferation is good for America because it will save a few bucks is idiotic on its surface. How much will it cost to have gotten it wrong even just a little?

2016-04-14	And she supported the war in Iraq. Just one of her celebrated blunders.
2016-04-14	What a deceptive headline. ANY Democratic nominee needs super-delegates to win. The point is that if there were no super-delegates (which I think would be good, since they've never over-turned the will of the voters), she'll have a clear majority of PLEDGED delegates and a clear majority of VOTES. And the super-delegates will ratify that result, but they won't play a role in deciding who the nominee is. They're only there for the possibility that the Democratic Party eventually has to deal with someone as horrible as Trump - THEN maybe they'd over rule the voters for the long term good of the party, but I can't imagine how else it would happen...
2016-04-14	Stay Stupid Sheeple, the DNC likes it that way! Haha
2016-04-14	David B Appling stay dumb, BS love ya!
2016-04-14	And if you really think about it, they are dealing with someone who may not be as bad as Trump....but at least as unelectable as Trump. Sanders may be super popular with the social media white kids, but if he were possibly nominated, he'd lose in a landslide.      His supporters need to tell me WHICH swing State is going to vote for for an old socialist that wants to raise taxes on EVERYONE, put in place 18 TRILLION dollars worth of freebies, and wreak havoc on the financial industry where millions and millions of Americans have their retirement accounts.      The Republicans would kill him with his record of supporting Leftist Latin American dictators and his past statements on weakening national defense. They need to tell me which swing State is going to vote for him after they do that? Hillary has mentioned none of these things. It would be a disaster of immense proportions if he were possibly nominated.
2016-04-14	She will get exactly what the DNC wants her to get...Bernie be damned.
2016-04-14	Bernie should win more votes than HRC, then he would have a legitimate claim to the nomination. HRC is getting exactly what the millions and millions of voters who chose her want her to get. Or do you really believe that your canidate is so special that he gets to win without getting more votes?
2016-04-14	sure, lets all blast media and DNC when our candidate is 2.5 million vote short. Way to go! so shmart!
2016-04-14	Jack Evans bernie is not my candidate. I hate the clinton crime family...bernie is just a plain idiot.
2016-04-14	a misleading headline......very.
2016-04-14	How's the truth misleading, moron? Haha
2016-04-14	David B Appling because she will probably not need them at all to clinch the nomination.
2016-04-14	David B Appling When this first started your boy Bernie was adamant that the superdelegates be forced to follow the will of the voters. Now that it's become clear that the will of the voters is against him, he has flip-flopped and now insists that the SD's factor in "momentum" and rally attendance and demographics, etc.,anything that will let him overturn the will of the Democrat voters.   BTW, the superdelegates were designed to prevent a situation like the republcans are facing, an outsider who has never been a party member, who has no allegiance or obligation to the party and is only interested in tearing the party apart from the inside. Trump and Sanders are two sides of the same coin.
2016-04-14	That's why the DNC came up with Superdelegates.. To always circumvent the will of the voters, Dang folks who vote for Democrats just aren't that bright. Hahaha #canyoufeelthebern
2016-04-14	The Bern is trying to circumvent the will of the people. He is behind in pledged delegates, he has no chance of catching her in terms of popular vote, his only hope is to steal the nomination from Hillary and the people.
2016-04-14	You fucking idiot you need super delegates to put you over the top in a competitive primary. How do you think Obama became the nominee?? God you Berniebots are fucking stupid.
2016-04-14	And yet, oddly, they have NEVER circumvented the will of the voters! If that had ever happened, it would have been BIG news. The only way it happens this time is if they somehow give the nomination to Bernie, who will have far fewer pledged delegates and votes than Hillary. They came up with them back in the early 1980's because they were sick of losing, but they never made a difference in a nomination fight...
2016-04-14	Sanders and his campaign are more and more showing their true colors, acting like the asshole Trump in every way. Cranky old finger pointing, mad-at-the-world Sanders. Can't lose with grace and decent character. This is how he has been for 40 years and why no superdelegates will support him.
2016-04-14	So you totally are missing the Sanders phenom. Looking at your FB account, it looks like you are actually not a person at all, just a TROLL.

2016-04-14	No.
2016-04-14	Just the type of people the democrats need. People who use rheortic such as "corproate whores". Great crowd Benrie, a real party unifying message.
2016-04-14	Please Holly. The American people have a right to be disgusted with politicians who place corporate money and influence over the people's best interest. Clinton, as well as the majority of the democrats, are bought and paid for. They have disgraced us for far too long, and it's time to call them out. The team "whore" in this context is in no way referring to a woman. Stop trying to cause a stink out of nothing, we aren't in 5th grade.
2016-04-14	Tony Sa You are as disgusting as the spokesman who was disciplined for using that kind of language. You have no facts whatsoever to support your vile smear, and by attacking Clinton and the majority of Democrats, you are proving the people who say that Sanders does not represent the majority of Democrats are right.   You like Sanders so much and you hate the majority of Democrats so much, great. Leave my Democratic Party. Go Third-Party wirth Bernie and see what happens.
2016-04-14	HIllary is the msot divisive figure in US politics. A female Trump. Exactly what American does not need after 8 years of Obama.
2016-04-14	SERIOUSLY!! Robby Mook, just give the man credit and shut up!! Even Brian Fallon gave him credit! To go after his crowd size even when NYPD has confirmed it, is just dispicable and jealousy at it's purest. Don't hate just because your candidate doesn't draw crowds even half that size.
2016-04-14	There are actually many many accounts on the news and social media via posts and photos that indicate it was no where near 27000. But even if so, drawing crowds that size is irrelevant. His crowds haven't turned into increased Dem turnout or votes for him since Hillary leads by 2.4 million. Most of the people that attend his rallies can't or don't vote for him. It includes families, children, people just curious, independents that can't vote, people who aren't registered, people who don't vote at all and in the case of NYC just plain visitors, tourists, and passersby.
2016-04-14	Keith Lowry Even MSNBC, CNN, most of the sites that I have looked at, and social media accounts have called it at 27,000 or more. Maybe we just aren't looking in the same places. Drawing crowds that size is very relevant. You have to excite people, otherwise they end up sitting out. I was going to either sit out this election or vote for Hillary, when it all started. I wasn't excited whatsoever. You can say turnout is down, but we also have to look at the fact that so many states have introduced so many new strict voter laws, that keep many people from being able to vote. Not to mention all of...See More
2016-04-14	Others have said it was much smaller than what Bernie's people claimed.   Bernie's people do this all the time, they exaggerate and lie to people and claim their "Movement" is much bigger and more powerful than it really is to give Sanders more credibility.
2016-04-14	Bernie needs to stop insulting whores by comparing them to the DNC
2016-04-14	Bernie neds to stop, period. He's toast.
2016-04-14	Ed Johnson While I am realistic about Bernie, I think it's ridiculous to suggest he stop his campaign when he's doing as well as he has been. Don't be so cranky, he's not hanging on for any unprecendented amount of time. I love seeing how pissed off Hillary supporters get about his last 8 victories though. Means he is repeatedly hitting a nerve.
2016-04-14	Ed Johnson he can stay in as long as he wants to taunt Hillbots like you
2016-04-14	And you better believe that mook, Hillary & the DNC have a plan for disenfranchising and dashing the hopes in the democratic process for all those new voters that Bernie is bringing into the political process.
2016-04-14	If they didn't register democrat or republican, they will not be allowed to vote in NY or NJ or other states left to go in the primaries. No one needs to disenfranchise them, like the Trump kids, they disenfranchise themselves.
2016-04-14	How cute..."the purist kind." And it's why the finger waggling old socialist is going to lose. He's even disqualified organizations like Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign as being part of his dreaded "establishment." As a matter of fact, he's disqualified so many of us with his purist thing that we will never vote for him.

2016-04-14	Don't forget Terrible Teddy and his theo-fascist, Bible-bangin' Bubbas! Even if Trump goes down, the Cruznado is waiting in the wings to blow the GOP right out of the race for the oval office.
2016-04-14	1/3 of 25% of registered voters. Let's see, that's 8.3%.
2016-04-14	Mpr Listener Burnsville : Are you trying to compare an absolute percentage with a difference?
2016-04-14	Mpr Listener Burnsville Over five million votes!
2016-04-14	Mpr Listener Burnsville my reference was that the 1/3 that supports his run as a third party candidate roughly reflects only 8.3% of registered voters. You can't win anything with 8.3%. In 2008, Obama received 52% of the popular vote, and 51.1% in 2012.
2016-04-14	One article says that Trump has the most support of any GOP candidate.      Another says that he is the most unpopular candidate since David Duke.      Wow. Just...wow.
2016-04-14	Both are accurate percentages. In the first poll, the UNIVERSE is the GOP voters, in the other, the US voters.      De nada...
2016-04-14	Ramon F. Herrera      Trump is the smartest idiot....the roundest square...the biggest shrimp...
2016-04-14	Tim Hoefling : By when do you suppose you Bern Feelers will pack your pipe dreams in a box, and start supporting Hillary enthusiastically, en masse?
2016-04-14	Translation: One-third of GOP would rather see Trump running than win the presidency.   Sharp crew, eh?

2016-04-14	Trump should just start his own party. Then he'd have the political leverage after the election (which both he and whoever the GOP nominee is will lose) to keep influencing the system and stay relevant as the leader of an actual party.
2016-04-14	Sort of like Ron Paul & Darth Nader?   They're still relevant, no?
2016-04-14	Jane Sheppard Neither of those 2 ever had the support Trump does. Trump has already taken the Lee Atwater Southern Strategy away from the GOP - he owns it now. He could have big influence as the leader of the low IQ/low information constituency that the GOP so carefully cultivated over the last 30 years, but no longer wants. Trump's party and the GOP could find common ground on issues like racial profiling and hatred of the non-white race to really push the conservative agenda forward.
2016-04-14	I tend to agree with you, Joe, except on this: "Trump's party and the GOP could find common ground on issues like racial profiling and hatred of the non-white races". The GOP has a half part which is based on RATIONALITY (the almighty buck). The other half (Social Conservatives) is based on hatred.
2016-04-14	She got off the plastic surgery table to make that statement? Geez
2016-04-14	Does that mean you think she looks pretty hot?
2016-04-14	Let's see how the race-baiting, gender exploting Democrats handle this Maryland Senate primary, one which pits an African American woman (Edwards) versus a white male (Van Hollen).      The diversity and inclusion crowd will be shown for the rank hypocirtes they've come to be..
2016-04-14	At least she knows how to construct a sentence Donn. Moron

2016-04-14	I stopped reading once he started talking about banks. Not everything is about banks.
2016-04-14	LMMFAO I screamed when I read this comment
2016-04-14	People who don't think Wall Street, the IMF, the resource extraction industry, etc have a major impact on their lives are naive at best. Much like people who don't believe politics affect them. Believe me, the people who run those institutions know the control they have over you.
2016-04-14	hahahahaha.      keep thinking that. DId you have to pre-pay your utility bill? Have you had to fund a bond issue for water to get into your home? Is your community thinking about building a new school, a new library, repairs to the firehouse or police station? Do you buy gas using a credit card?      I could keep going on and on. The banks touch everything in your life, even your church, yes, even your relationship to the Almighty is touched by them today.
2016-04-14	he doesn't have respect for Hillary, what a lie. If he respected her, his supporters and surrogates wouldn't call her every horrible name they can think of.

2016-04-14	You want to talk about name calling. I was recently called a nasty ass nigger fagot that should go lick mamas pussy some more. That was the first sentence of her tirade. Was sent a vile inbox on facebook while being blocked at the time. Couldn't report her or anything. So don't tell me us Sanders supporters are vile. You people are far worse than any tea party person I've spoken to. Btw I'm a white male.
2016-04-14	Like racist, sexist, dirty jew, nazi (for some reason) etc... it goes both ways.

2016-04-14	They sure as hell weren't impressed with Hillary.
2016-04-14	Actually, he got a standing ovation. According to NYT, their response to Hillary's speech the day prior was, and I quote, "lukewarm".

2016-04-14	Trump Got It Right Again. This Is the Undeniable Proof...      http://survivemagazine85566.blogspot.com   This is Donald Trump's most shocking statement yet,      However the mainstream media isn't saying a word about it!      What are they really trying to cover up?   I'm sending this to all my friends, family and patriot brothers......See More
2016-04-14	If Hillary Clinton is elected president, the African-Americans in this country will soon find out who she listens to "after" an election. It won't be them. She'll listen to them again when she runs for re-election when she lists all the crumbs she has provided for them in her first term.   And they'll vote for her again, hoping for more crumbs in her second term. If African Americans ever really want to know why they haven't made more progress in the past 200 yerars, they will need to listen to someone who will tell them what a real progressive is
2016-04-14	Thank you for knowing what's best for the African American community. Not at all dismissive of a whole community... Much.
2016-04-14	Hugh Johnson      Everyone who disagrees with you is a racist dim wit?
2016-04-14	I'm black and I approve everything Steve said. Why? Because it is the truth. If anyone has any facts that dispute that then please by all means lets here them. If it is the truth then it is the truth. And here's another truth: systemic white supremacy and its historical control of our institutions is very real. Please refute that as well if you can. Those blacks in the south that voted for Hillary were victims of their cultural inheritance. Tradition plays a large cultural purposes, especially for those whose experiences are rooted in the history of slavery. Unfortunately the more politically adept know this and they, again, fell for the okie doke. bernie Sanders is hard for them to understand. His policies aren't the neoliberal racebaiting type so it's hard for them to process. Plus bill clinton with his southern charm has made great inroads in endearing himself to southern blacks, but for the sophisticated and informed among us, we call bullshit.

2016-04-14	That is the only phrase he knows in the Bible. LOL
2016-04-14	No surprise there, coming from someone who sees no need for asking God for forgiveness, despite his insistence that he is an evangelical Presbyterian. Though most Christians are eager to share the "good news" with others, I'm pretty sure that any deeper questioning of Trump's beliefs would be met with that go-to "it's very personal" response.
2016-04-14	yeah - one of his favorite avoidance tactics - "I really can't say, shouldn't say...gee whiz you know" - kicking the dirt with his shoe

2016-04-14	Well, Trump just proved that he is NOT a Christian, since he knowingly, willfully, and joyfully does exactly the opposite of Jesus' commandments and teaching.
2016-04-14	Do his supporters actually really listen to the way he even speaks?? I don't think this man can put together one coherent sentence. Good Grief....
2016-04-14	utterly amazing he is
2016-04-14	He sounds like a thug or mob boss most of the time.......and acts like one too.
2016-04-14	Mr.Trump, , Matthew 7:8 says something like, Say unto them, Ye hypocrites, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.   Just sayin.
2016-04-14	and thank you for doing so

2016-04-14	Well, Ted Cruz has destroyed any hope that he would work with Congress. He is showing that he hasn't learned anything about politics since he got in the Senate. Like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, he doesn't learn from experience. And that will cost him.      What will he say when asked, "If Congress refuses to consider your VAT tax and elimination of the IRS, will you work with both parties on a tax reform bill that can get through Congress? Is it your way or the highway?"      I hope @CNBC will ask that question when he spends an hour there tomorrow morning.
2016-04-14	Is Ted Cruz signalling that he won't move to the center after the convention? Is he saying that his domination theology and mission will be to impose his version of man written "Christianity" on America and the world? There will be no denominations or cults other than his?      If Cruz answers @CNBC tax question tomorrow morning with his standard @VAT tax and eliminate the @IRS talking points, no one watching the show will ever take him seriously on any issue. His VAT tax would be as dead on arrival in Congress as any of Bernie Sanders' outlandish promises.      It's time for Ted Cruz to get real and show he's ready to be president.
2016-04-14	Donald E. L. Johnson That would require that he, in fact, be ready to be president.
2016-04-14	This weak and pathetic "Republican" Congress gave Obama everything he wanted even though he faught them on every bill they wanted. A Republican president as smart as Cruz will get everything he wants in one form or another from this group. It will be fun watching them work together dismantling most of the crap legislation put into effect by Harry and Nancy.
2016-04-14	Can't pick a dog in this fight. Both Cruz and McConnell are doing a lot of harm to the country. One shuts the government down and the other doesn't allow it to function in the first place. We'd be better off without both of them.
2016-04-14	Article 1' Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution gives the power to shut down the entire U.S. Government to a junior senator. Oh wait, I guess a lawmaker doesn't have that kind of power. How wrong-headed to believe a narrative like that no matter how many times the ObamaMedia repeat it.
2016-04-14	Cruz is the only politician today that means what he says. Go Ted!
2016-04-14	LOL, hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Sorry. could not help it.
2016-04-14	Neal Levine Well perhaps you trust the uber flopper flipper Hillary, you are old enough not to buy into Bernies nutty world, right?

2016-04-14	Republicans aka voter repression party.
2016-04-14	how did the Republicans cause long lines, Toni?
2016-04-14	Repression takes many forms. Take hardworking Americans who work in civil service and/or unions. If they want to work at their normal pace, they asked to slow their pace so that others might look bad. You may be taking a higher road, if in fact the Arizona Republicans repress votes. But if so, is is only marginally better than the moaners and groaners who complain about having to work at all. Obviously, that is not all civil service or union employees. But it's also true that many Republicans do in fact try to get out the vote and would be appalled if someone in their party did attempt to repress votes.      Voters in most civilized states allow mail-in ballots: Arizona is one of them. Why don't the party leaders of both parties in all states encourage voters to use the mail-in ballot?
2016-04-14	Roy Ellis Try reading the article - they drastically reduced the number of voting places

2016-04-14	Roy Eliis: Did you even bother to read the article? Anyone with a brain knows it is voter suppression that caused the long lineups. They went from 200 precincts in 2012 to 60 in 2016 in Mariposa County alone.
2016-04-14	Gary Hernandez you gat my point.....son
2016-04-14	More government incompetence.      The Dems think we should make the government responsible for more things when they can't even manage the things they are already in charge of.      Yeah, that's what I do at work -- find an employee who is already overwhelmed and then pile even more on their plate. Jesus, you people are stupid.
2016-04-14	It wasnt incompetence moron...it was deliberate criminal behavior.
2016-04-14	Andy Cutler: The Arizona Secretary of State is a Republican. She is the one being sued for suppressing the vote which is something Republicans like to do. They like to cheat...look at Wisconsin...

2016-04-14	He is a liar just like his protoge Donald Trump. That is why Ted Cruz is called Mini Trump. He is the second most hated individual within the Republican party. LOL
2016-04-14	Seriously, I mean I know you are likely a below average intelligence, just being a female GOPer, but that really is the best counter argument you can come up with??
2016-04-14	Is THAT why cons have a hard time telling the truth? Because of liberal interviewers? Doesn't that also make cons extremely weak minded?

2016-04-14	I wonder how Cruz who got loans to go to College and has paid those loans back is vilied for it when Obama used Him being as being a Foriegn born student to get a break on his College cost. and has He ever paid it back the Money given to pay for his education? Did Cruz have a Saudi Prince write a Letter to help him Get into College? Obama had a Letter from one.
2016-04-14	Why did Trump hire this looser.
2016-04-14	Trump should propse simple reform. After 2016, every State will conduct a primary to elect the delegates. There will be no more caucuses, or 'voter-less' selection of delegates like Colorado.
2016-04-14	A very authoritarian idea. What happened to individual states.
2016-04-14	Tim Doran Individual States will hold administer all aspects of the primaries, they just can't select voter-less delegates. If every State decides to select voter-less delegates, they would be returning to the era where the party bosses 'selected' the party nominee in smokefilled rooms. We have come a long way, we need to make it better to reflect voter's will, not the will of party machine. We should also eliminate winner 'take it all' delegates like Florida did. The delegates should be divided proportionately.
2016-04-14	But I though he hired all the best people.

2016-04-14	Jesse Cooday Call my house and you'll get the air horn..After Bernie pulled his "She is not qualified" crap--I knew what a sexist jerk he was.....He is NOT QUALIFIED to do much beyond rants and do his doom and gloom number...
2016-04-14	Not much of a sample so I wouldn't put a ton of faith in it but it is better than a poll showing her slipping behind.
2016-04-14	All polls are this size -- 350 to 600 or so people. That's why polling is a science.
2016-04-14	John Smith Lies,lies, all lies. -- It's hard to face facts.

2016-04-14	5.7 million registered Democrats in New York. They asked 591 people lol.
2016-04-14	All these polls have a small sample size. That is what polling is. NBC/WSJ most reputable of local polling.
2016-04-14	That's what polling is...a sample...
2016-04-14	Polls and statistics are scientific, random, and have a level of confidence.
2016-04-14	New York Dem values on full display voting for someone who has profited from a charity scam
2016-04-14	You're full of it. The Clinton Foundation has been investigated over and over and it's nothing like the "scam" you say it is. As a matter of fact it uses almost 90% of it's donations to actually help people......which is way above the industry standard. What have YOU ever done to help desperate people in need? My guess is NOTHING.
2016-04-14	You should Google how much time and money she has donated from the time of her graduation from college to now. Bernie didn't have a real job until he was 39 years old.
2016-04-14	Read up on Trump University and the various criminal investigations and pending lawsuits. Now that's a scam.
2016-04-14	I like Bernie Sanders, but so want to see the Dems retain control of the W.H. Both share my values, but believe Hillary has a better chance... mostly because a lot of Bernie's wonderful core ideas would be exposed as "not feasible" during the general election.   .   My dream... a Hillary/Bernie ticket, but there already may be too much bad blood for that to happen.
2016-04-14	He can go back and start the revolution in the Senate where it needs it most, see how that flys.
2016-04-14	Something else about Bernie, AAL: He is VERY narrow. Imagine, in your mind, a pie chart with many different color segments that represents all of the policy areas that a Presdient must deal with. Then imagine such a chart with about 4% marked as areas in which Sanders is focused. Wall Street. Income inequality. That's about it. Important issues yes, but the guy knows little about and has little interest in anything else.      Example: When the campaign swung to foreign policy and national security after San Bernadino Sanders embarrassed himself. He couldn't begin to speak intelligently about those CRITICAL issues. Why? He has no interest in them. Never has. 26 years in Congress, and he's paper thin on foreign policy.      Sanders is unfit to be President because he's so narrow.
2016-04-14	he's too old
2016-04-14	pataki commands a lot of influence in his finished basement
2016-04-14	Who endorsed who, when and where? Or yes I forgot why?
2016-04-14	They are twins.........one loser endorsing another loser.....Kasich
2016-04-14	Yawn. Time for a snarky comment that by endorsing Kasich, George hopes that a deadlocked convention will look to Pataki to save the day. When a guy polls at 0% and calculating in the MoE, could he have negative votes?
2016-04-14	It's true Pataki didn't go anywhere nationally, but I bet there are a lot of Republican primary voters - who do skew generally older - who remember Pataki's 3 terms as governor pretty fondly.      Especially when you consider that Pataki was followed by the embarrassing Spitzer and Paterson eras.
2016-04-14	Well he may be a disaster for the national GOP, but you see the state party largely backing him because he'll lose New York a little less than someone like Ted Cruz would.
2016-04-14	Who?
2016-04-14	The writer fails to acknowledge that Clinton holds a significant lead in Pledged Delegates, as well as Super-delegates. Bernie loses on both accounts.
2016-04-14	Exactly. She leads by 2.4 million votes, also by over 200 delegates, not even considering the superdelegates.
2016-04-14	Karen Tahir The vote count ignores Caucus states.      Thanks for disenfranchising nearly 11 American states.

2016-04-14	http://usuncut.com/.../bernie-sanders-leads-new-national.../
2016-04-14	Bernie started off as a postive candiate, the nengativity of his recent remarks combined with the brutual negativity of his followers had hurt him (ever so slightly), but at a time when you need to be gaining ground he is loosing it. The deligate fight is a red hearing. The super deligates will flock to whoever wins the elected deligate race. Right now it looks like Clinton is comfortably in the lead, and nothing has changed to alter the dynamics of the race.
2016-04-14	there's not enough room in one campaign for 2 bedbugs
2016-04-14	If truth be told, she probably couldn't find Wyoming on a map.

2016-04-14	Aaaaaand you're a cowardly dingbat! Palin puts her real identity behind her words, you cower behind a fake identity as you throw stones! Speaking of stones, castrated liberal males have none, especially the ones with fake online identities or the douchebag Obama-voter who threw tomatoes at Palin! You people are laughable :-)

2016-04-14	She wants us to read a transcript on him and yet stil will not release her speech transcripts... or her emails.

2016-04-14	Hillary has had her chance to prove leadership ability, and it has been a disappointing failure. When Bernie Sanders and Hillary Rodham Clinton have been given the same information, and the the same choices, the differences have been startling. When they got the same information about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, one supported the disasterous destruction of the nation, while the other sought to look for better ways to deal with a shitty situation.      Bernie and Hillary both have the qualifications to be president (unlike either the first term obstructionist Ted Cruz or the bombastic real...See More
2016-04-14	Tom - Just curious, clearly you are a democrat or support the democrat party. Can you expalin what made President Obama qualified to be President when he ran as a first term Senator from Illinois and then explain why Cruz, the first term Senator from Texas is not qualified.      Professors at Harvard are on record stating they have no recollection of President Obama as a student while they all remember Cruz and have all stated he was one of the brightest Law Students they have ever had in their classroom.      So education and performance during such said education leans heavily to Cruz.      Other than their education, what exactly is it then that made Obama qualified but Cruz is not?      By the way, before you go off the deep end, I do not support Cruz, I just cannot stand partisan shills like youurself who are hypocrites.
2016-04-14	Todd Smith First of all, I appreciate your question and the fact that you don't make assumptions about myself (until you call me a partisan shill, that really puts a dent in our friendship). To answer it, Barack Obama the candidate had many strengths and weaknesses in 2008. Looking back, the American people clearly made him out to be something he wasn't, a transformative leader. What he could do better than anyone else was sell his vision of what America could be (Donald Trump is also pretty good at this, note I don't think this trait is necessarily a good or bad thing). He projected an idea o...See More

2016-04-14	sanders Friday night tax return dump      lol
2016-04-14	2014? That's it?
2016-04-14	Well Bernie Sanders, today is Friday: Where are your full tax returns and many of the previous years????
2016-04-14	Just released them...he was right very boring ;). Now let's if Hills realeases her transcripts :D :D :D..probably not though cause she's like that.
2016-04-14	So sorry you all can't, once again, find any scandal connected to Bernie. Now stop salivating and rubbing your hands together in anticipation.
2016-04-14	Could give two craps about a scandal. I'm not a Bernie not. My problem is that he just don't have the competence or knowledge to be the leader of the country. Also for years he trashed the Democratic Party...now suddenly he is a democrat?
2016-04-14	Irene Miscione I'm sorry, but for years he has not trashed the Democratic Party, but has for the most part voted with them. With the exception of not voting for the Iraq war, which even Hillary now says her vote for it was a mistake.His intelligence, knowledge and competence have been proven over and over again throughout his years as a public servant. i will respectfully listen to any facts you have to the contrary.
2016-04-14	Only one? Seriously...does he think we are THAT stupid? Why are all their assets in HER name?
2016-04-14	Sanders is a cranky old man. Hillary is showing how much more knowledgeable she is than Bernie.
2016-04-14	Yes Knowledgable at how to evade questions!
2016-04-14	Hugh Johnson in the few pieces that I got to watch, she didn't answer a question posed to her about the Palestinians and is still evading releasing the transcripts of her speech to Goldman Sachs, saying that she's "being held to a different standard". Firstly, she's running against Bernie Sanders, not the GOP, and Bernie doesn't have any speeches to release. Secondly, Bernie Sanders has already committed to releasing his tax returns, so that's not a good excuse. Finally, it's a *huge* conflict of interests, so if there's nothing damning in her speeches then it would behoove her to release them!      I'm sure there were at least a handful of instances where she dodged the question that I didn't see. Planning on watching the whole thing later today.
2016-04-14	Zing!
2016-04-14	Release the transcripts, Hildabeast.
2016-04-14	I WENT to your facebook page https://www.facebook.com/lorainecolley.weaver.5 after reading your comment/ language on Hillary. YOU ARE A BIBLE THUMPER ON YOUR FACE BOOK PAGE... Pretending to be a christian while using vile langauge ... lol
2016-04-14	Hugh Johnson He said he's release one today and the rest are coming. Hillary on the other hand plays politician and avoids the topic because you and I know very well why Big money contributes to her campaign. They're not stupid, neither is the public.
2016-04-14	Jay Majumdar You stalked Loraine's facebook? Wow that's so creepy. Definitely something a teenager would do. Grow up, old man.
2016-04-14	Release the transcrips and let us judge for ourselves.   Just like you released your emails... oh wait. my bad.
2016-04-14	spoken like a tea bagger...      go to the filing cabinet and make copies of the tax returns. Why can't jane fly back and make copies and release it?
2016-04-14	Jay Majumdar Tea bagger? Because she is being investigated by the FBI? It's a legit topic
2016-04-14	Hugh Johnson Is that the only line, he released his 2014 today. But don't worry, what you won't find are 250,000 speaking fees on it.
2016-04-14	I really don't like Sanders. I used to but man he is a nasty old dude. All he does is insinuate and make accusations but has no proof.
2016-04-14	That's the opposite of what he does, are you kidding me. Idk what's more ridiculous that sentence or the video of Clinton saying "cut it out" to Wallstreet
2016-04-14	Did you watch the debate? Do you think people just give money to campaigns because they just like to? If you do then theres very little else to say. Anyway she did reverse her position because of campaign money, look up Elizabeth Warren critique of Hillary Clinton.
2016-04-14	Crazy old Bernie. Just a washed up ol 60s hippy throwback. The best and brightest the DNC has to offer.

2016-04-14	How about releasing the transcripts of speeches you've made supporting Leftist Latin American Dictators, Bernie? Or how about releasing transcripts of speeches you've made calling for a 50% reduction in military spending, or the elmination of the CIA or the dismantling of the nuclear arsenal? I'm sure I'd like to read the transcripts of THOSE speeches Bernie and I'm sure millions of other voters would like to read them too.
2016-04-14	Seriously? You want him to release the transcripts, and then you go on to seemingly quote the speeches, like you already have the transcripts. I guess that's what a Cal State education buys you. Fucking tool.
2016-04-14	Her speeches are well known can you provide refernces to the Sanders speeches you are referring to?
2016-04-14	Daniel Younan FTW!!!!!
2016-04-14	Bernie already used this joke. Try again.
2016-04-14	And Hillary has already avoided this issue time and again. Everytime she does, it makes the American people question what is so bad about these speeches that she can't release them.
2016-04-14	Tom Planamento I'm an American people, and I don't expect her to release them. Not if the other candidates arent going to do the same.
2016-04-14	Pete Miller I don't expect her to release them, and I expect it's probably because she said something that would sink her campaign.
2016-04-14	Clinton's the best. I admire her cuning. The transcripts.... much ado about nothing. Do you think Clinton is concerned about that... She's not even concerned about the 4000 soldiers she helped send to die uselessly in Iraq. Pffff no problems for her. Her supporter's won't care either. Amercian soldiers... Pffff don't care. Not my fault. I helped Bush send them to die. But it's not my fault. Bush's fault. His decision with my help... but HIS decision. Clean hands. No remore. Supporters are not giving a shyt about that. I win.
2016-04-14	She is running for the Democratic nomination for president. Everyone else in the race has released every speech they have made to Wall Street executives behind closed door. Democrats are demanding their nominee stand up to Wall Street CEOs and other corporate interests, and HRC is completely dropping the ball.
2016-04-14	I can't seem to find the link to these alleged released documents that you referred to. Can you provide it please?
2016-04-14	Pete Miller Here they are! He didn't give any! Hillary Clinton is running for the Democratic nomination for president, a fact she wants to overlook. Bernie Sanders is the only person she is currently running against. Clinton wants to wait to release the transcripts until her opponents are Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, because then she will be the only choice for liberals. As it is, any of her speeches will be good for the Sanders campaign, as they will show that she lacks passion for reforming the industry that nearly bankrupted our nation less than a decade ago.

2016-04-14	Democrats have to learn from Barack Obama's presidency. He came in having received a mandate from the American people on issues as diverse as the Iraq War, the economy and healthcare reform, and actively engaged in seeking bipartisan support on issues that affect the entire country. The Republicans stone walled him so hard that his supporters never had a chance to fix the problems in Washington.      If elected president, Hillary or Bernie cannot go to Congress and try to find the best deal possible; the Republicans in Congress have been very vocal in saying that they have no intention on helping...See More
2016-04-14	i think Obama ran circles around the GOP and got everyting he wanted .................
2016-04-14	When exactly did obama actively seek bipartisan support? Seriously? Heck obama didn't even consult his own party leaders in Congress except when he needed them to save his butt over one sorry program after another.      It's amazing that anyone could say with a straight face that obama tried to work with anyone, period.
2016-04-14	Cathy Comeau Smith From about 9:20 to 12 minutes into the Frontline documentary "Inside Obama's Presidency":      "That first week [of Obama's first term], the president had two goals: turn the economy around, and do it by working together with the Republicans" . "He put together a huge 800 billion dollar stimulus package designed to jumpstart the economy; and he tailored it to appeal to the Republicans." "He decided to make a symbolic gesture; he would come to them...he head right for the meeting of the Republican caucus...the Republicans had a surprise for the new president...he finds that they'...See More
2016-04-14	SANDERS the epitome of an ill informed and ignorkant idiot
2016-04-14	Same old cranky, grumpy, mad-at-the-world Sanders fooling young gullible people that believe everyone gets free lollipops and balloons with their free college and health care.
2016-04-14	Here's a list of policy positions for you, which includes a detailed look at funding his proposals. https://berniesanders.com/issues/
2016-04-14	Sanders reached back 20 years for a comment? And anyway, aren't gangs "super predators"?      This guy has lost it. He's becoming unhinged. I hope that this debate contributes to him getting BLASTED next Tuesday. Blasted enough that, while he surely won't quit, he can be ignored.
2016-04-14	Anything said during adulthood should be fair game. Clinton has used things he said in the 80's against him.
2016-04-14	Daniel Younan Clinton is free to use anything against Sanders while he was in elected office. Sanders holds Hillary for her husband's positions from 30 years ago when she wasn't in elected office! The only trade bill she's ever actually voted on was CAFTA which she voted against. Yet he blabs about NAFTA as if she had a vote. She had nothing to do with the crime bills in the 90's that were authored by Republicans and Joe Biden and passed OVERWHELMINGLY by a Democratic congress, Bill Clinton signed them. Yet suddenly Hillary is responsible as First Lady? Give me a break.
2016-04-14	Hope Royaltey The Clinton's said they were a two for one presidency, when Bill was president and she campaigned for the crime bill, she can't run away from that now. Bill just defended the crime bill and the super predator term a few days ago.
2016-04-14	Sanders was pandering. He voted for the crime bill too. lol
2016-04-14	After is was going to pass anyway and after he spoke out against some of the controversial provisions to congress, and after they added laguage to protect women. Here's him speaking to the house in 1994      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTn3jUoMdVI
2016-04-14	Erik Pye Nice try. he voted for it, he bragged about voting for it in 2006 andhe had an opinion on it that would have put even more people in prison. Read it and weep.   http://www.thedailybeast.com/.../when-bernie-sanders...
2016-04-14	Erik Pye So he was against it before he was for it?
2016-04-14	What a raging hypocrite. This article says it all about his support for the crime bill.      http://www.thedailybeast.com/.../when-bernie-sanders...

2016-04-14	@Kathleen Lake and BS has the NRA and the crime bill he voted for. BTW he is one thing I find funny yes we know that Sanders didn't vote for going into Iraq, but it turns out he did vote for several bills that funded President Bush's war in Iraq. Talk about BS being the grand hypocrite!

They also criticized his language which they called often "amateurish, divisive — and downright coarse."      But, hey! Why NOT have him run for President? What could go wrong?

2016-04-14	Americans think they had it bad during the great recession and the wars in Iraq etc under Trump it will get much worse. Trump policies will destroy the country, look at the policies forget the noise, the USA will no longer be the Democracy the world looks up to. Communist China will take the USA place in the world countries like Russia who is eager to replace the US will welcome Trump because they know he is Americas downfall, Putin even endorsed him yes the same Putin who was brought in to challenge America break up Nato and influence Europe. The credibily of the US will be lost, if Trump gets elected dark times ahead for the world. People have very short memories, those who do not learn from the past are doomed to make the same mistakes.
2016-04-14	Well you said a lot there but you didn't say much; can you expand on your points please? For example how will America no longer be a democracy? (Forgetting for the moments it's a constitutionally limited republic, not a democracy). China is no longer commie, and I don't understand your point about Putin.

2016-04-14	Tony, it would be far worse in NY with Trump as president. Trump Tower would become the new World Trade Centre prime target for Muslim extremists. Trump Tower lessees would find their insurance going through the roof, along with surrounding buildings. Depending where his family live, that would require extra security, particularly as there would be extra security threats. Bush was hated, but Trump is in another league of hatred. Regardless of Trump's future electoral failures or success, he is gonna need 24/7 security for the rest of his life. If he survives 12 months, it will be an absolute miracle.
2016-04-14	Wait did Hillary just move North Carolina out of the Deep South bracket?
2016-04-14	Politically speaking at least its certainly in a different category as it went for Obama in 2008 and still seems to pretty much be in the swing state category. (At least those labelling by political category often put Virginia and North Carolina in a different category to account for how different they can be in at least national politics compared to say Mississippi or Albama.)      There are also certain demographic trends in the state which suggests it is likely to end up even more of a potential swing state going forward.

He has a much better record than Clinton, who seems to only care when it doesn't conflict with her wealthy constituency (and it often does). Watch some of his old speeches on youtube. Give him a chance. He's on your side even if you're not on his.
2016-04-14	Simon Magus He belongs to a party of one
2016-04-14	So Bernie wins Idaho, Utah, Wyoming and Alaska. Pretty deep red States. His deep South argument is hypocritical. Democrats in Red States also have a right to choose who their Democratic nominee should be.
2016-04-14	What happened to his 50 state strategy?
2016-04-14	Did he say they didn't? Were we listening to the same thing? He just said he lost there. That was still early in the voting process. He was getting killed early on when he had no name recognition. I think the turning point came in Arizone, when they finally seemed to get on more equal footing. Clinton won by a whisker, but Sanders actually won the with the people who voted on the day of the primary. Clinton only edged ahead because of people who sent their ballots early. Since then he's done WAY better. You can argue any kinda numbers you want, but it's true that the better voters get to know Bernie, the better he does. Doesn't mean he wins every contest, but he's catching up.
2016-04-14	Tom Gavin I also seriously doubt that Democrats in the deep South are conservative. I think his answer should have been we carry the young vote, but we are having trouble carrying the minority vote. President Obama won the presidency because he carried the minority vote.
2016-04-14	Not only did Bernie lose the South he also forgot to hold rallies there...
2016-04-14	Exactly. BS wrote South Carolina off. He didn't even try to compete there. Hillary didn't write off Sanders' strongholds. She campaigned in New Hampshire and took her defeat with grace. She campaigned in Elizabeth Warren territory -- and beat BS!

2016-04-14	Nothing she said was wrong.   I am so sick of people getting pissed off at rudeness. It seems that as long as you are "polite" you can say any bullshit and get away with it.
2016-04-14	If you had a disagreement with your boss, is that how you would talk to them? What if you were the boss? Is that how you would treat your subordinates if you disagreed with them? That's not how you treat people, and it's not how you effectively voice your disagreement. Being vulgar usually doesn't advance productive conversations, because the target of the vulgar language probably isn't going to feel like having a productive conversation after being called an asshole and told to fuck off.
2016-04-14	Then your just another asshole.
2016-04-14	I am sick of RUDE people that create an atmosphere of hate and intolerance, and incite violence.
2016-04-14	She should be fired. No place for that in public life. I can't stand Netanyahu either and I basically agree with her, but NO excuse for that talk.      I am getting sick of people being RUDE. You can't say whatever you want just by being polite - you can politely libel someone and get charged for it. But you can say A LOT MORE by being polite, and as another person noted, be a lot more effective too. Bad manners are NOT ok in pubilc, partly due to public decency, and partly due to the fact that they can start a downward spiral that ends in things much worse than verbal vulgarity - witness the violence surrounding the Trump campaign.

2016-04-14	Sorry, but Netanyahu has treated President Obama like the colored help, with rudeness and slights at the heart of everything he's done. We KNOW Clinton is not going to stand up to him, because Pander is her middle name. It's nice someone called him for the insane Zionist that he is.      Bernie should have just told a CPT joke and everyone would have given the campaign a pass. No, probably not. Only Clinton can support illegal foreign invasions, show dramatically poor judgment when it comes to foreign policy, and get away with it. Or give speeches to Goldman Sachs for a quarter million a pop, and inform attendees that big banks weren't the problem with the economic collapse.

2016-04-15	If Donald Trump's 2016 run for President has done anything, it has awakened many people in America to the fact that the free country they thought they lived in is really a socialist dictatorship. Today, our government in Washington is made up of only one political socialist establishment that masquerades as being both Republican and Democrat with a common goal of world and domestic domination. In the US today, we are no longer represented by our elected officials, but dictated to by appointed administrators. ""      So whine On Donald. George Washington was the greatest whiner of all time when he challenged King George,.
2016-04-15	how exactly is our govermemt socialist?
2016-04-15	It is not even remotely close to some socialist vision your meds seem to cause.
2016-04-15	Suzanne Klump not really socislist, in that the government doesn't own the means of production or financial institutions.... we have what is known as a fascist economic system where those institutions are controlled by the government.
2016-04-15	Anyone doubting if Trump is a true conservative need do nothing more than listen to him whine. It's a true Republican trait. It's what they do best. They're incapable of actual governing but experts at sitting back while others do the work. Then once the work by others is done, they jump in to whine, criticize and complain. So Trump fits right into this lazy band of bums - no talk or work on policies and plans - just an endless bitch session by a bunch of whiners. He's a conservative alright.
2016-04-15	GOP: 'Trump does not reflect our party" Trump is a total reflection of the bigotry, gun insanity and religious bullshit, that you have promoted to get votes from the mindless people in the South and Bible Belt.      GOP: Trump is whining. No Shit! That is your entire fking modus operandi. Trump learned this from you, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh. Every time you morons attack people, there is blowback and then you whine that you are the victim. Just like the hateful bigots in NC. You whine about the war on Christmas. You whine about the clothes people wear.      We each build our own world and live in it. You losers have created a world of lies, hate, false religion, a tendency and need to bully and then the ultimate bully issue.............the minute there is blowback, you are the victim. You built the world you live in. Deal with it.
2016-04-15	Well put. Like getting mad at the mirror when you don't like your own reflection in it.
2016-04-15	George Feinn That's why they whine about being called bigots and racists.. they don't like being forced to look into the mirror.
2016-04-15	The GOP is in full disarray; thank you, Donald Trump for so many political schadenfreude moments.
2016-04-15	Thomas Nickerson: Hillary's nomination is a foregone conclusion. So it's little wonder turnout is not great      But hey, you wanna see Democratic turnout?      Make the 2016 election about nominating Supreme Court justices. Democrats will be coming back from the dead (normally an issue in every election LOL) to prevent Trump or Cruz from controlling SCOTUS      Blocking Obama's nomination will go down as one of the greatest, all-time political blunders
2016-04-15	Thomas Nickerson Sanders supporters are NOT Democrats. They are independents freeloading off the Dem primary system.
2016-04-15	Thomas Nickerson That's some fantasyland you're living in....
2016-04-15	There's no way that they would give every single delegate the ability to stop the proceedings with points of order. It would be logistically impossible and the potential for a public debacle enormous. But by all means, go right ahead. It'll be the most entertaining thing since Breaking Bad.
2016-04-15	That's actually how it's currently set up. Robert's Rules allow for any member of is audience to propose something, and it must be seconded to continue. Then discussion follows. The proposed rule change would be sort of a modified Robert's Rules, whereby a majority would be needed to continue discussion of a proposal.
2016-04-15	Phil Lisi, I know how Robert's Rules work, but are you sure that's how it currently works? How would people even get to a microphone?

2016-04-15	Re: The corrupt political election structure of America.      I see the corruption everywhere in our political system and believe we have come to the end of the life cycle of the miracle of the American Democracy.      I am ashamed to admit I had no complete understanding of the entire election process. I was so dumb I really thought my vote counted. After listening to all the news and reading how the processes really work I am reminded again of the old saying: “he who has the gold rules”.

2016-04-15	Lend Mahdrof So do you honestly think that, as a result of this supposed caucus, that Cruz legitimately won all the delegates?? I truly find that hard to believe because, at that time, there were 17 candidates.
2016-04-15	Lest you think the RNC is taking the high ground this election season.......if the racists and Neo-Nazis, which make up a significant part of Trump's base, were voting for Bush, Walker, even Cruz..........the GOP would happily accept their votes.      They're really not fooling anyone.      Lay down with dogs and.....wake up with Trump as your nominee
2016-04-15	Can you cite some facts to back that up? I'd like to check it. Thanks.

2016-04-15	You keep dreaming. If she had in any way "won" that debate, you would see headlines all over the place about her "domination" of the event. As it stands, the news media is treating it like it almost never happened. - which is right along with how they have repeatedly tried to downplay Sanders' popularity over Clinton. She is a liar and crook and you'll soon be seeing her drop out of the race because of indictments over her criminal acts withthe emails. Deal with it.

Make the rich pay for all our "free" stuff. 52 trillion dollars saved on tax money since 1981. 4,4oo millionaires in 1980 and now 7.5 million millionaires in 2016. 52 trillion. The tax man is coming and 343 million bitchzz smacks are coming with him.
2016-04-15	Bernie didn't give a crap about down ticket candidates until just before the debate. He knew Clinton had raised millions so he deceptively jumped in just in case she called him out. His integrity is a joke.

2016-04-15	The GOP spent years trying to deligitimize President Obama. Now the tables have turned. It has taken less than a year to deligitimize the GOP done by the two most hated people in the GOP. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, Mini Trump. The GOP will never be the same again.
2016-04-15	Trump also forgets that many of the people who have created "the rules" are those that have been elected by the citizens of Colorado. If they are unhappy they need to understand that voting at ALL levels of government has consequences. Also Trump is all about using the tax "rules" to his advantage but when he drops the ball elsewhere he whines about the "unfair" rules. He is a baby whining because someone out manuevered the "great" business man.
2016-04-15	Syl Sidel The GOP is run by politican who are electe by the people. This is part of the point I am trying to make-the rules have been there. Citizens cannot wait until a Presidential compaign to suddenly decide they are engaged in the process - and then complain they do not like the process. As for Trump he should have been aware of this process before he even decided to run - he is complaining because he got out manuevered.
2016-04-15	Once again Trump the opportunist using anger and fear to get close to Republican voters. The simple fact is he has no public service experience which means he doesn't have a clue how society and government works. He's on the outside looking in and finding all the flaws which are already known. He thinks its the same as business, but its not even close. You don't fire other publicly elected officals or dictate to groups of citizens who have rights and their own power blocks. Threats get you just so far in public office so his abilty to work in the system is questionable to acheive the results he's promising. A lot is going right in society as well as things going wrong and all he'll be doing is trade one set of problems for others, most likely far far worse by the way he's talking.
2016-04-15	The rules have been out there since before Trump decided to run. He knew them or could have known them. The fact that he did not know them speaks for his rank amateurism. He is out of his element, if indeed he has an element to be out of.
2016-04-15	It really does not matter what the RNC has to say anymore. They lost control of the party months ago
2016-04-15	Does it matter if the estmated 5-7 million GOP conservative voters who are saying they will sit it out if Trump gets it? 37% of popular vote and 45% of delegates and "they're cheating me!!!!!!!!! I'm a poor little rich boy with white illiterate old men following me. We are such victims". BTW-I'm a Cruz follower and want you and your cult leader to stay away from young girls. Cruz is 20 points ahead with College graduate GOP voters and Trump is 20 points ahead with HS and below.. Hillary 25% ahead against Trump with college grads. Romney was even with Hillary.

2016-04-15	The GOP rank and file has shown to be volatile and attracted to bright shiny things which is not a good idea to give too much weight to their momentary fascination with the latest and most outrageous candidates.

2016-04-15	Monzell Lewis      If my mom, sister or wife lodged a false accusation and tried to deprive an innocent man of his reputation, livelihood and freedom, I would be ashamed of them.      Fields should face legal consequence for her actions. This kind of false accusation is despicable. Females and males should be treated equaly under the law - just because someone is female should not grant them special privileges. Only a biased sexist would feel differently.
2016-04-15	She counted on the Sisterhood to rise up in irrational, righteous anger and   support her no matter what. No matter that her suit was a joke and her actions are a set-   back to women.
2016-04-15	you are the setback to women. filing charges is something i encourage my daughter or any woman to do if some random asshole pushes her around, but maybe a fatherless prick like you doesnt have the same concerns
2016-04-15	Dave Watson   Read the story, Einstein. The prosecutors office cited her for her behavior. She wasted   everyone's time with her frivolity. If you would encourage your daughter to file   charges, you would be doing her no favor.
2016-04-15	George Read I recall first it was that Lewandowski did not touch her at all and that she was crazy. Then it change to one of the security guards touched her. Then it was ok I touched her but she was not faling down or something. But then when they realized a batterry does not need to include an assult just a touching and he was charged, that is when the self defense argument came into the picture. So lets just say the end result does not bowed well for Trump and Lewandowski looks like a hit man. :)
2016-04-15	ah yes, its her fault
2016-04-15	That's what the Dem prosecutors said
2016-04-15	Cuomo should tell that lying lady to come and apologise. I only hope that media would give this Lewandowski's reprieve the same daily coverage they gave his indictment. Bad people!!
2016-04-15	There was no indictment, only a charge.
2016-04-15	This went exactly as I predicted. Now Mr Lewandowski needs to refuse to talk about it any further, other than to say the prosecutors made the correct analysis.

2016-04-15	I think the issue is two fold. 1) HOW the delegates were selected to be voted on. In GA, if you read about it, it certainly seems as though he has a complaint. Trump delegates were pushed off the docket in a state where he won in a landslide. 2) Just because the rules are in place, doesn't make them good ones. How is limiting the power of people's votes ever a good thing? The counter argument that Trump has a higher percentage of delegates than votes doesn't really hold water, because I'm winner take all states, at least they are a decided by a vote of the people.

2016-04-15	Matt Micros There should be a blanket system nation wide. Primaries with citizens voting all done in the same manner.Winner of the primary gets all the delegates. Simplfy the process and it's hard to be sneaky and cheat. But if I had my way nothing could be done at all for an upcoming election until Jan 1 the election year. Enough of the constant campaigning. If anybody even says they are thinking about running before Jan 1 they are disqualified.
2016-04-15	Fast food restaurants have had the ability to completely replace humans for a long time. So why don't they? Because humans by nature want to interact with other humans.      The first fast food joint to replace the human workforce will quickly go out of business. McDonald's has already replaced as many people as they dare. This whole argument from Rafael is bogus.

2016-04-15	Annual Salary for Min wage is 15k per year right now.      An Ipad costs 600 bucks.      Raising the min wage isn't doing anything to increase the rate of worker replacement by automation. Ipads are already ridiculously cheaper than a human employee.      Finally, I am not sure what human jobs are replaced by Ipads bc somebody still has to use the ipad.
2016-04-15	Uhm, I think he means you can use your own Ipad to order the food and pay for it. Like ordering a pizza, except the customer will be standing or sitting in the restaurant at the time.
2016-04-15	David J. Lekse Yeah they do that at Uno's. Nobody uses the tablet for ordering...they still have waitresses for that. THey come to your table and use the ipad to enter your order right there...then they leave it and patrons just use it for games.
2016-04-15	If you think iPads are replacing humans, you belong to the Hollywood sect of "Computers = Magic".      Do you know why this isn't happening? Because it's more expensive to automate than to hire a worker. You have to deal with all the maintenance, you have to deal with the installation costs, and then you still need to have someone flesh and blood in there to make sure nothing goes wrong.      So, for trading in your minimum wage employee, you're getting a higher paid employee, a massive up front cost, and a reocurring expense.      Doesn't sound like much of a savings, does it?

His father believes as well as his wife and himself that he is destined by GOD to become President of the US. Something on the same level as the second coming of Christ. He is a charlitan,a liar who trained well from his protoge Donald Trump and is the second most hated individual within the Republican party. Donald Trump is number one.

2016-04-15	Too bad New York has closed primaries and the deadline for party re-affiliation was October 9th. I'm not sure why the media is even trying to make the New York race seem suspensful. I'm more interested in how the campaigns shift afterwards.
2016-04-15	you might be the dumbest person on the internet, ...... LOL - #ByeByeBernOUT! ;)
2016-04-15	Chris Nolan Huh? All I did was state a fact. The voting rules almost guarantee a Clinton win on Tuesday
2016-04-15	Chris - I'm a big bernie supporter, but its unfortunately true that the NY Primary is set up in a way where you had to pick a party 6 months before the primary. Voters actually had to pick a party affiliation BEFORE the first democratic debate happened back in October.      The system is situated to keep those who play by its rules the best in power.
2016-04-15	I thought Clinton's pivot to saying she would sign a $15 an hour minimum wage bill if Congress put it on her desk was fair. I would love it if all three branches were Democratic and really working for the people, but that is highly unlikely to happen. If it did happen, that would mean that populist ideas were ascendant. As things stand now and are likely to stand for the time being, a $12 minimum wage is far more realistic, and most people know it. Bernie would do well to throw support to Congressional candidates who are likely to actually win if he wants his ideas to see the light of day.
2016-04-15	The problem is, if you limit yourself to what is easy and attainable, you will never get anything accomplished. You have to shift the Overton window to make real progress, and Clinton is unwilling to do so. The things Sanders is proposing wouldn't even cause anyone to bat an eye in Europe, but they are treated as impossible in the US. It's not that they are hard to do, we just need to shine a light on those that are blocking the bills and making it very clear they are doing so because they are owned by corporations and billionaires, not the people.
2016-04-15	Seth O'Bannion That's not true. Since Sanders will have to compromise not matter what, if he demands outrages items the other side will likely do so too. Here is a question for you. Say Sanders becomes president and he pushes for Medicare for all, what will he be willing to give up in a compromise to get it?
2016-04-15	Seth O'Bannion Getting Congress to raise the minimum wage is never easy. Moving it from $7.25 to even $12 is hardly a small feat. If you dismiss anything achievable as weak, guess what? Nothing gets achieved.

2016-04-15	America was built on greed, how quickly they forget. The difference is that during era of FDR and later it was used to bring about social change that bettered average Americans. Its only with the Republican ascent to power that it has been unharnessed again leaving behind the old problems of a lowering of social economic standards today. Poverty was being reduced and education improving for average Americans, that has slowed and stopped. This is the issue before us, not the simplistic animal instincts of greed. How its used by society is the real issue
2016-04-15	How much Greed is it? In Dollars? What is the income of the Rich, in Dollars?
2016-04-15	Matt Potter Greed is an animal instinct run amok. Its just like hoarding when you see on television people's houses overflowing with junk because they can't part with any of it in spite of the fact it will never be used. Some of the rich are no different than common hoarders. As a kid I knew an old neighbor that we later found out owned rows of giant apartment houses; yet he lived like a poor bum. He went around collecting junk from trash cans and had a junk cart that he'd take out on the street. How can you tell if someone is a hoarder is the question. The answer is when it interferes with living in society.

2016-04-15	Any loss Portman has will be more and off set by People that includes independents like me that wants to make sure no more liberal judges of Obama on the court and I will for sure go vote for Portman because of his stance against all Obama does but especially this supreme court decesion
2016-04-15	Betty. I see you have no vision for direction of the country. Just against the twice elected President of this great country. How does it feel to be out of touch without direction?
2016-04-15	John Fellows and she has no direction. a complete unknown
2016-04-15	John Fellows How can I be out of touch, I agree American people elected Obama two times but in 2014 realized there mistake and after 6 years Obama and Harry Reid deciding the adjenda of the Senate they elected a Republican senate to create the adjunda and sot crazy liberal judges like this one who would destroy 2nd amendement so now we get republican setting the Senate ajenda , THANK GOD FOR THE REPUBLICAN SENATE AND THEY MUST HOLD THE LINE ON JUDGES OF OBAMA TO PROTECT MY GRAND KIDS AND YOURS IF YOU HAVE ANY.
2016-04-15	"Portman and other Republicans insist the issue that will not be top of mind for voters at the ballot box in November."      But I thought this whole thing was about giving the people a voice in the next Supreme Court justice. If he's saying the people don't really care, what are McConnell and Grassley on about? Follow 160+ years of precedent and hold a vote on the person currently nominated for the vacancy.

2016-04-15	She isn't up 17. That poll was landline only and pre debate.      I'm guessing she wins by 7 or 8 points.      Anything over 10 and Sanders should suspend his campaign, but again, I think it will be closer than that, and Sanders will call a close loss "momentum", which he will then use to fundraise off of.
2016-04-15	Mark Hendricks, NBC/WSJ also 17 point margin and the RCP average is 14. Bernie had a bad night last night when he told black people their votes shouldn't count.

2016-04-15	Crowds didn't help Eugene V Debs to be elected... and they won't help Bernie either. He is a tax and spend socialist who looks to Wall Street to pay his way. New Yorkers can see behind his false promises. They know that Hillary will do the hard work it takes to improve lives for all Americans.
2016-04-15	Russ Wolske Well, at least Hillary will do the hard work to ensure the Clinton's lives are improved. Any improvement for others will be purely incidental......      But you're right about Bernard....
2016-04-15	Yet again with these rallies? rallies do not translate into votes and delegates. They might have been interesting at the beginning of the campaign but now its gotten to be old news.
2016-04-15	You don't want the insinuation? Release the transcripts. Easy peasy.
2016-04-15	We both know this isn't an honest request. ANY word out of place would be used to attack Hillary by the Bernie camp. They don't want transparency, they want attack ad material and Clinton is smart not to give it to them. If she had said anything earth shaking to Wall Street, we would have heard about it by now as the room was not hermetically sealed.
2016-04-15	Cheryl Onstad They already have it based on her refusal. The only way for Hilalry to win this issue is to release the transcripts and have them be innocuous or to have never given the speeches in the first place. All her refusal does is keep it in the news.
2016-04-15	Cheryl Onstad LOL!!
2016-04-15	How can anybody defend her pulled-out-of-thin-air criteria for releasing the transcripts. She has no obligation to release them and if she is refusing to, then she should just come out and say it.

2016-04-15	Maybe because this request was first made by Karl Rove.
2016-04-15	Tobye Oliver Why would anyone give anything to Rove?
2016-04-15	What insinuation? He called her out on it repeatedly. I'll insinuate that Politico is purchased, like Shrillary, but how to call you out like Shrillary has been, time and again?
2016-04-15	Face it, he is losing and Politico is not the reason. Blame it on the rain if you like but it will not change the delegate count. You guys can blame blacks, Politico, Wall Street or who/whatever you like, but this all boils down to votes and delegates.
2016-04-15	William Johnson LOL! You mean that winners only win so they can lose? What the hell are you even talking about? You Shrillary addicts can't even think in linear fashion, and like your idol, attack with cute sounding, non sequitur catchphrases. Go read some history books.
2016-04-15	William Johnson - Suppose HRC does get the nomination. She'll lose the independent vote in the General...partly because she's unliked, partly out of spite. No, it's not childish for an independent to cast their vote opposite of the DNC - like super delegates, independents can vote for who they want, when they want...or not at all. Either way, serves a bad day to the Clinton campaign
2016-04-15	Hillary's transcripts are important to me. Unless I get more information I will NOT vote for her. I'll be writing in Bernie.
2016-04-15	Eileen Shaeffer no it's his opinion and right...
2016-04-15	That's awesome, Rusy. Just don't pretend you are a progressive. No progressive would allow 22 million people to lose their health insurance because they didnt get to approve a transcript, no progressive would send 5 million kids back to a country they have never known because you didnt see HRC's transcripts, no progressive would allow gigantic steps backwards in voting rights, SSM, climate change, min wage, immigration reform, and far more...because you didnt read someone's paid speech.

2016-04-15	Gary Allen, sounds like a good idea to me. Republicans know democrats have 247 electoral votes pretty locked up and you only need 270. Which means they only need 23 from the swing states. I believe Charles Manson could get 23 electoral votes against Trump or Cruz.

2016-04-15	Susan Anthony - Just imagine we would have had President Gore instead of Duh-Bya's Reign of Errors
2016-04-15	The Republican elit is probably slapping their foreheads. The electoral college is the only thing that has kept the Republicans competitive in presidential elections for the last 24 years.
2016-04-15	Susan Anthony Right, Susan. I find it amusing that Republicans don't get that they have more or less been structurally eliminated from contention for the White House. However, I am glad that Carson feels that Gore should have been the President in 2000 since he won 500,000 more votes than Bush.

2016-04-15	Susan Anthony Time has come for a straight up and down vote by the people, for the people. No electoral college anymore. Winner takes all.
2016-04-15	Ben needs to take a course in American history and gain a better understanding of the Constitution and how the framers put it together instead of shooting from the hip and saying stupid things!
2016-04-15	Susan Anthony Our Presidential elections ARE delegate selection. The whole point of the electoral college is to take it out of the hands of the people, so a demagogue like Trump couldn't win the office.
2016-04-15	He can't help it. Think of it as the brain tumor talking, not him.
2016-04-15	Christopher Myers You've basically just stated the United States isn't a democracy in saying this, you know this right? I don't disagree, just wanna make sure you're aware of this.
2016-04-15	Why do we need these stupid voter ID laws
2016-04-15	We don't. It's just another means to deprive poor people of the right to vote. Jim Crow by another name.

2016-04-15	they have both told you its ok to steal money from people who worked for it so that you don't have to work,anything else is just socialist fairy dust..you pathetic traitor!
2016-04-15	Just about everything you mentioned is a reason to not support hillary. A unified currency with the peso? Wtf have you been smoking. Making illegal immigrants citizens within three weeks of giving birth to an achor baby, yeah that's not a recipe for disaster. And what american value are you referring too?      Get help or better yet just stay home and please don't vote, you are destroying this country.
2016-04-15	Please stop calling Staten Island "the rock." Nobody calls it that, except the NY Times, which does get stuff wrong. I was born on SI and have never heard this term. The rock is Alcatraz, other side of the country.

2016-04-15	Joel Soto I'll call it 'Duane'.
2016-04-15	Hey, let's all toast Donald Trump! He's brought out the dying demographic of the rascist and xenophobic voters, for one last hurrah! Get a good look at 'em. They are, what once was, a powerful voting bloc. Here's to Trump!
2016-04-15	oh look another proud black racist,you people are pathetic.
2016-04-15	Rick Honaker and turning off just as many in the Republican party.
2016-04-15	Rick Honaker BINGO, now go back to sleep in your single wide!
2016-04-15	If Trump offered free jackboots and KKK hoods to wear at his rallies, he'd draw an even bigger crowd. The Trump Brand -- from Trump vodka to Trump steaks to Trump "University" and even to the failed Trump casinos, the Trump Brand will always find it's easy marks of suckers to profit off of. Go Trump!

2016-04-15	How much we have idiots. And here's one of them. thoughtlessly assumes absolute nonsense, repeating for drүgimi. But they at least know that Trump as president can expel them warm boroughs. What do you lose? Or are you too joined up to the trough?
2016-04-15	Rick Honaker You do know that Trump has a tendency to exaggerate if not outright lie, right? He demands that the cameras be on him at all times so no one can see the crowd. He grossly exaggerated the crowd @ Staten Island, saying there were thousands waiting to get in. A video showed the only ones outside were protesters. He has done this from Day One... manipulated what people see and hear so he can tell them anything. Like a dictatorship or the Wizard of Oz. What's behind that curtain, you gullible supporters?? He is an epic manipulater. If the crowd gets restless or disinterested, he brings up The Wall to get people riled up. I can't believe you've fallen for it.
2016-04-15	Martin O Marley is a LOOSER... Angling for Sanders lost campaign V.P. position... Go LOOSER!!!
2016-04-15	The only "looser" here is you, loser.
2016-04-15	Brandon Scott What the heck is it about that word. I am very sick & tired of seeing it mispeled. :)
2016-04-15	Bill Go, I see it all the time and I hope it is as simple as people not checking their auto-correct for mistakes.
2016-04-15	Transcript from a private sector speech made by a woman is not a requirement in presidential campaigns, taxes is. Why are you not calling Bernard sanders to release his taxes for the past 29 years he has been working in the private sector as mayor, congressman and senator..... No wonder you failed, LOOSER O'Marley
2016-04-15	Tax returns: Also not a requirement. It's tradition. You're 0/2 so far. Bernie Sanders and his wife, Jane, have done their own taxes for years. The literal filing cabinets in their home require some digging through to find old tax returns. Do you really think the least wealthy member of the Senate has something to hide in his tax returns? Hillary Clinton made as much from three speeches to Goldman Sachs as Senator Sanders's entire net worth.
2016-04-15	Another guy that can spell LOSER. Argh................
2016-04-15	Bill Go It's the same guy hahaha
2016-04-15	Hey Martin! Tax returns are NOT the same thing as what is said in a "speeches for hire" scenerio to business groups.      For christsake man, those "featured speaker" gigs Hillary did were not "behind closed doors" political fund raisers like the 49% fiasco where Mitt Robme made his derogatory statements about how he and the top 1% (r)s really feel about almost half of all Americans.      Given the absurdity of your gross false equivalency with this tweet O'Malley, no wonder you never even made it out of the starting gate...
2016-04-15	Our loss.
2016-04-15	If the general public was invited to those Goldman Sach slumber parties, and she won't release the text, then by definition they were 'behind closed doors'.      But seriously, do you not see the ethical conflict of interests from any politician making $400K from the very financial instutions they want the job of police?      Doesn't that strike you as rather incestuous??
2016-04-15	Eric John ...   Keep your friends close...And your enemies closer. Doesn't that strike YOU as rather incestuous??   Or is that kind of 3D political chess playing by people who know how the game of political power is REALLY played - Like Hillary - beyond your intellectual capacity there Festus?
2016-04-15	This is just so stupid. Hillary was being paid to make a speech for a company. What does one do when they make a speech for someone? They integrate what it is that they want you for (ie Secretary of State) and you talk about how this company can do better or compete better or the realities they must contend with. So there's going to be things in the speech that some dork like Sanders will try to use to get more support because CLEARLY he won't have enough on his own merits to be the nominee.....

2016-04-15	The just show the damn transcripts if she has nothing to hide. One can just arriving to the conclusion that if someone is so reluctant to show something it is because they are definitely hiding something. We are not talking about a private citizen. This is a public figure who chose public life because it was a good way for her to get rich. And has been pushing to be president for many years. So many voters would like to verify that she says the same thing in public that she says in private and making those transcripts available would be a very good way to shut her critics... Unless of course she is being dishonest
2016-04-15	Dantanna Dcny The conclusion here, I believe, was that she does have something to hide, just that it's none of your damn business.
2016-04-15	Martin O'Malley is a sore loser who is trying desperately to remain relevant. Useless idiot.
2016-04-15	So as part of the TOP 1% they only paid 18% in taxes, wow he is a great liberal
2016-04-15	Roy Ellis $400k is not top 1% and they gave a lot to charity.
2016-04-15	Cheryl Onstad the top 1% starts at $428,000 and Obama want all charity deduction gone
2016-04-15	Cheryl Onstad - I truly hate to admit it, but technically....Roy.....is....correct (hangs head).      $428,713 of adjusted gross is the line for 1%. Obama's where $436,065      http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/income-rank/   http://www.kiplinger.com/.../T054-C000-S001-your-rank-as...

2016-04-15	Yes but with speaking fees at about 200 bucks a pop not to mention book deals his financial future is looking very bright indeed.
2016-04-15	Which makes him different from every other President how? Oh...I forgot, there IS something different about this president.
2016-04-15	After he left office, the sainted Ronnie was making up to a milllion a shot on the speaking circuit.
2016-04-15	Carl Rice he is different from the previous president, what is W's rate for a speach? Less than zero?
2016-04-15	He's already the most powerful man in the world. I always thought paying a president was a bit redundant.
2016-04-15	Yah being on the job for 24x7x365x4 hardly deserves compensation. Maybe you should get a real job before judging others.
2016-04-15	Scott Henricks He wasn't working 24x7 when he went to bed while our folks were under attack in Benghazi. He needed his rest as he had a fundraiser in Las Vegas the next day.
2016-04-15	Scott Henricks Sorry if it sounded like I was making a disparaging comment about our president. I merely was implying that a couple hundred grand to him isn't really that meaningful. He'll be a multi-multi-millionare in retirement. Also, I certainly don't mind that he gets paid. It's just funny because most CEOs earn millions of dollars a year for doing a substaintially less important job. All around pretty funny.

He's an opportunist praying on the fears and hardships of the American people... The US isn't a business, and he is still yet to show us any feasible plans/ policies to improve America. Now go fuck you're cousin an let me enjoy my weekend :)
2016-04-15	Dev On At your age two things...1) You have not a clue what Trump stands for. You don't care and neither do I you just took the time to bash him. 2) Don't let your mother, if you know her, know you talk like that 'cause sooner or later your going to get your young ass kicked but good. I suspect not for the first time either.

2016-04-15	Ben Doverer You know this because of your deep reserch on fox news?
2016-04-15	Hmmm... Trump is a billionaire. Omidyar is a billionaire. Trumps business--real estate-- cannot benifit from cheap foriegn labor either inside or outside the country. Omidyar's business, to a large degree, involves selling cheap Chinese goods into the US market; a business that would shrink if a tariff on Chinese goods made US-produced goods more competitive.      But Trump doesn't have the interests of ordinary Americans at heart; while Omidyar is a saint?

2016-04-15	Just finished watching this interview with Ted Cruz on CNBC and it was refreshing to see a politician so gifted on substance, knowledge and an economic path forward for this country. After the pointless bickering and he said she said lies of the campaigns this year I would encourage those with an open mind and a concern about this country moving forward to please watch this interview, if even in part, no matter who you may be voting for. Thanks and may God bless everyone.      http://therightscoop.com/must-watch-ted-cruzs-full.../
2016-04-15	Um, you do know Cruz wants to go back to the gold standard, don't you? Doesn't get much crazier than that.
2016-04-15	Henry Pennant Some folks might not understand what going back to the gold stadard would mean for the economy. Pretty scary position, if you ask me.
2016-04-15	Adolf Trump, the candidate with no substance on solutions, is a fraud and liar. How can anyone vote for a person with no substance. He is clueless. Dump Trump.
2016-04-15	Nice to call 50% of republicans or 30-40% of them these names you uppity piece of shit.
2016-04-15	Somebody should test the water in NYC for lead poisoning ... obviously they are not thinking straight.      Trump does not have the maturity to hold office.   He promotes hate.   His domestic and foreign policies will be a disaster.      Yes, people want change ... but this will be a change for the worse.
2016-04-15	How does preaching hate differentiate Trump from ANY Republican running? Get a grip. Kasich Trump and Cruz all believe in the same idiotic conservative crap that has been wrong forever.

2016-04-15	Larry Tork Don't you find it ironic that Sanders is pandering to the richest and most conservative institution in the World?
2016-04-15	I admire Joe Biden I do but I don't get his point except he is trying to down play Sanders invitation. It is true that Sanders did not get a meeting with the pope however you can't take the invitation to speak away from sanders. Nor the honor bestwoed on Sanders. The invitation at the popes request, even without apersonal meeting with the pope meant the pope feels what Sanders is saying is right and this was a huge acknowledgement . If he didn't see the merit he wouldn't have invited.
2016-04-15	I wholeheartedly agree.
2016-04-15	Sanders didn't get an invitation. He wrangled it from a group that's only associated with the Vatican and then lied about it to make it look like the Pope himself invited old Bernie up for a talk. Even the leader of the group that issued the invitation was angry because she had never been asked for her input. It was Bernie playing the Pope for political purposes and that's ALL it was. If Hillary had done it, you people would be on here hating on her big time.
2016-04-15	Bruce Hill   Not true. A monsignor said he invited him with the leader's consent.   http://www.thedailybeast.com/.../vatican-pope-didn-t...
2016-04-15	In fact, the Pope has stated that conservative economic policies are unChristian. Yet some people live by the principles of greed and money worship.
2016-04-15	Larry Tork I'm so disappointed. I really thought he was a better man than that.

2016-04-15	Let's see transcript of Sanders talk to NRA for their support of his elections.      Go ahead, make my day.
2016-04-15	You can google the videos of the speeches on YouTube.
2016-04-15	Id like to see the last 6 years at least. We have the Clintons back to 1992. Heck even Marco Rubio put out since 2000. Sanders and Trump need to release them all atleast dating back to 2010.
2016-04-15	As soon as we get those transcripts. Everyone still in the race has put them out (when they did speeches, which wasn't many of them), so now all we have to do is wait on Clinton. I mean, there's nothing untoward in them, right?
2016-04-15	Lola James huh? He can release them for years prior to 2014. Has nothing to do with 2015.
2016-04-15	John Kowols I'm confused why you're even talking about that. I said nothing about transcripts. I said I want tax returns for candidates of both parties. You must be blind.
2016-04-15	He released just one year of tax returns?

2016-04-15	Tom Clark right, meeting with pope, lmao.      Sanders tried to pull a Kim Davis, except pope refuse to meet him. Lol
2016-04-15	Trump has a point - the Republicans have backed every single trade deal regardless of the effects on American workers.      I think more this issue is almost as important in explaining Trump's support as the immigration issue. Cruz doesn't have any realistic plan to help middle class Americans, except the heinous 16% VAT tax proposal so he can lower income taxes to 10% for the super rich.

2016-04-15	What's wrong with free trade? What's wrong with a 16% corporate tax? What's wrong with a 10% flat tax? And most importantly what's wrong with being rich? They pay most of the taxes in the country...if you make them poorer guess who's going to make up the difference in the lost tax revenue?

2016-04-15	Adolf Trump is nothing but a big loud mouth liar and bigot. He knows Cruz does not support Chinese money manipulation, but he tells everyone he does. What a liar! Trump is only out for Trump and to #ell with everyone else. He took $150,000 in money that was suppose to go to small businesses affected on 9/11. What a thief! Trump doesn't care about people, jobs, immigration, and security of the U.S. 80% of all his workers in his hotels come from outside the U.S. Trump wont even hire U.S. workers. He hires immigrants and pays a cheap salary. Trump is a fraud and liar. Dump Trump.

2016-04-15	Bill and Hillary Clinton are perfect examples of why I know longer nor shall I ever be a " New Democrat."      In the 1980'a the Republican party started their move to conservatism, but the democrats also moved to the right in the 90's with Bill Clinton.      Senators Merkley, Brown, and Warren are throwbacks and I admire them immensely, but I do miss the days when liberals actually had a voice.

2016-04-15	Actually I told my mom three days ago Bernie would love to pour gasoline and light the entire financial district of NYC on fire. He is such a hater. It's really kind of scary how much he hates Wall Street. It's like an unhealthy obsession, just like the people who are unhealthy obsessed with making dirty back room trades and deals on Wall Street. I don't understand either of them, really. There are good ethical people who work there and went to Harvard, Stanford, Duke, just great business and financial schools that are husbands and dads and moms and wives. he speaks of them all as one, "Wall Street". He's also forgetting insurance industry, there's huge shady deals there too.

2016-04-16	A lot of good information in this article. Really explains how Clinton has not really “been raising money for down ballot Democrats” like she claims. And remember yesterday while Benie was discussing wealth inequality and poverty at the Vatican, Clinton went to two big money fundraisers in CA where she raked in 15 million dollars! One of them was selling tickets for $350,000 a piece, because, you know, all those peasants can just eat cake.

For a presidential election, you should not be able to declare until 6 months before the general election. No corporate, union, small business, chamber of commerce, or Pac money.They should be publicly financed with no more than $2500 from any individual (including billionaires).

How can Democrats take back the Senate with just 3 candidates?????????????      Will those 3 even support a liberal nomination to SCOTUS??? Or will the "purity" test work against liberals.

2016-04-16	This is corruption at its finest, hey pledge you superdelegate status to me and I'll make sure you will have money for your reelection. So instead of Wall Street buying loyalty from Hillary, Hillary had bought superdelegates way back in August with wall streets, the 1%, and special interest groups money. Man has the circle of big money and favors and influence payed off for Hillary except she missed the tact that most Americans see this as corruption. This shows 100% that the DNC has rigged this election for Hillary. This is in fact buying delegates
2016-04-16	Micah when you get a little older and have a few real world experience maybe you will begin to understand that it takes a team effort to make real changes. Bernie can promise everything you want to hear but it doesn't mean he can deliver any of it. Hillary understands that it takes more than one person. It takes a Democratic congress along witha Democratic President to make change happen.      You should have learned that lesson with the Senate immigration bill when it went over to the House Republicans.
2016-04-16	Scott Henricks you mean the bill that the SPLC and LULAC excoriated because it created a migrant worker program with conditions like this? https://www.splcenter.org/.../close-slavery-guestworker...      If you're going to be an insufferable, unwavering supporter of the former Sec., at least have the facts on hand to present a half-palatable case.
2016-04-16	She doesn't miss the fact that most see it as corruption. Politicians have set themselves above the law. What she is doing, no matter how contemptible (at a time when over 20% of America's children are hungry) is perfectly legal. (In urban areas, the number of hungry children is 35%)
2016-04-16	This is what Hillary means when she says she raises money for down ticket Dems. It's really just a way to fund her campaign by getting around maximum contribution restrictions. she made deals with state parties that likely included super delegate commitments: http://www.counterpunch.org/.../how-hillary-clinton.../

As for "dildo suppression", I think we'd rather not encroach on your sexual proclivities.
2016-04-16	Paul King Cruz would like to encroach on your sexual proclivities. At least until he hears Trump say the government shouldn't be doing that, then he'll change his stance.

2016-04-16	Endorsed who ? Seriously ?      Well, have fun getting re-elected. Nevadans are not know for their tolerance of stupidity.
2016-04-16	He was already re-elected.
2016-04-16	The odd thing about this endorsement. Sandoval is not in the least bit a social conservative. He is pro-choice, pro-gay marriage, raised taxes for education. The one thing they have in common is the fact they were among the first to install Obamacare.

2016-04-16	he's a clone of mccain and romney, both losers.
2016-04-16	Trump is the only one that isn't a DC insider. So you're saying you like the way our country is going? Honestly, are you insane? Haven't you noticed what the hell has been going on the past 30 years? You frickin kidding me? Open borders? Does Mexico allow Guatamalans to treat us the way they want us to treat Mexicans? Let's start there. What is Mexico's policy on illegal immigration and how do they treat the criminals that break their laws. Waiting for your answer.

2016-04-16	Funny, but this article doesn't mention $400,000 cost of private jet and that it was paid for by Bernie's campaign--but the trip, of course, wasn't political. Just goes to show you what a $27 contribution will get you. Bernie is a total fraud.
2016-04-16	As a Bernie supporter and with 5 donations under my belt, I wholeheartedly approve as do many of my fellow "Berners". Find something else to complain about.
2016-04-16	After Bernie Sanders attacked Hillary Clinton on Climate Change and the Fossil Fuel industry, he rented a private 767 jet to fly to Rome. "With a range of 6,408 miles on a full tank of gas, it can be calculated that a 767 like Sanders' flying 4,435 miles from New York to Rome uses approximately 16,596 gallons of fuel. The round-trip flight will use approximately 33,193 gallons.      On average, an American flies only 7,500 miles per year, according to AmericanForests.org, 1,360 fewer miles than Sanders' round-trip Rome travel. Thus, an average American releases less carbon emissions via aircraft each year than Sanders did in 24 hours."      http://www.dailymail.co.uk/.../Bernie-Sanders-takes...

2016-04-16	FIVE minutes in the lobby of the Vatican living quarters. Even Pope Francis says it was NOT a meeting. Just a common courtesy (and that is probably meant sarcastically, since Sanders Stalking the Pope was an uncommon DIScourtesy.
2016-04-16	Tom Scott, Hillary sucks... Get over yourself.      5 min with the Pope is more meaningful than anything anyone else has accomplished
2016-04-16	Nic Jennings Ever???...
2016-04-16	The way I figure it, Trump is going to come out with a trick like meeting with his BFF Jesus. Or at least with his BFF David Duke.

2016-04-16	Don Beaupre, Thank you for that link. This out of Pope Francis' own mouth, that he did not have a meeting with Bernie, but a chance encounter only. Once again this proves what a liar Bernie is and how far he'll go to pander.
2016-04-16	Beverly Ann Howard , just like when he met Kim Davis, blessed her and gave her a rosary, but oh, "I didn't even know what I was doing!! I didn't know who she was!! My handlers just told me to go and bow down before her and kiss and wash her feet" What a liar they BOTH are!!

And if Cruz can figure that mess out why can't the Donald with his brillant business mind-after alll he hired the best minds to run his campaign did he not-so why can't they get their stuff together.      That is a guy who has planning this race for years ( he had an expolaretory committee back in 2000) and he still don't get how the game works.

2016-04-16	Trump is a clown, and a crybaby too.
2016-04-16	And both HIDEY and Ted Cruz are ALCOHOLICS.
2016-04-16	It is reminiscent of THE TORTIS AND THE HARE. It is a marathon and not a sprint. Cruz obviously knows what he is doing while Trump has to rely on free air time from the networks covering his rants. The Wyoming result seems to vindicate Colorado's Convention result. Trump's fallacious charges of stollen votes must now also apply to Wyoming.
2016-04-16	You lie!! Wyoming just mirrors colorado. It's like comparing 6 and half dozen..This is cheating.      Any delegate selection without voters participation is fraud. Spin it the way you want, what happened in colorado and Wyoming was fraud perpetrated by the RNC just to deny Trump. Lie all the way you want, that was what everyone saw.
2016-04-16	Rather see a primary of caucus in the primaries. NOT this crap.
2016-04-16	Still a pig and still an ugly person.
2016-04-16	That's what Rosie said. And she's right.
2016-04-16	Republicans (conservatives in general) have a VERY simplistic mind. Everything is black and white to them. Their favorite movies are from Disney (good guy, bad guy) and their hero is John Wayne. They focus on looks and appearances: the polite and diplomatic act of bowing is insulting to them.      Liberals have a much more complex mind. They focus in substance and intellect. Ugly broads like Janet Reno, Napolitano or Golda Meier would NEVER make it in the Republicans Party. Dumb bimbos (Palin, Bachmann, O'Donnell) would never make it in the Democratic Party.      Just compare the women in Faux vs. CNN and -specially- MSNBC.      In the Conservative mind:      A good looking person ==> a good person   A bad looking person ==> a bad person....See More

2016-04-17	Cheryl Onstad right? Republicans will be giddy if Bernie wins the nomination. He is a socialist with clear radical history to tap ( like a honeymoon in the USSR) America will not elect a Socialist. It is too deep in our psyche. We will never elect a socialist
2016-04-17	Comments such as yours make Sanders' supporters look bad. Uniformed conspiracy theories are usually a province of the far right. And nationals match up polls mean nothing at this point; they only give media and gullible people talking points.

2016-04-17	No, they don't. I'm wondering even if actual votes matter.

2016-04-17	The real issue is VOTERs were not aware and now all hell is going to break lose.
2016-04-17	Tammy McKinnon   Why were they not aware? Most American's spend more time selecting apples at the grocery store than they do considering the selection process of those who would represent their political interests.
2016-04-17	Primaries aren't supposed to be democratic. Its the method used for the party to select its nominee and are private entities. They are free to select their candidates anyway they desire. And people are free to vote for that party or not. You get a crack at democracy in November. If a party thinks the candidate does not represent their values they are obliged to find another candidate. They are stuck with no one
2016-04-17	So why go through the motions and pretend that the voters are key? Why the charade? It costs $$$$ to have elections and caucuses and they are all for show. (BTW I know you are right about the process being run by private entities )
2016-04-17	Thatter Branch Someone is gonna give your computer a virus, GTFO
2016-04-17	You are right about this. If it's a matter of Trump losing delegates because he wasn't organized or didn't understand the process, I don't have any sympathy for him. If it's a matter of the Republican Party, either at the State or National level, front loading Trump delegates with people sympathetic and rooting for Cruz, then that's not right.
2016-04-17	It does not matter. Both Cruz/ Mini Trump abpnd Donald Trump are the same no natter which one gets the nomination. And it really does not matter either how many delegates that Mini Trump takes away from Donald Trump. It has taken 8 years for the GOP to try to deligitimize President Obama. It has taken Donald Trump only 6 months to deligitimize the GOP. He has discredited the GOP system and It truly does not matter anymore what the rules are. The Trumpster will use this to his advantage at the convention. The sound that you hear is the GOP imploding.

2016-04-17	Kalyan Biswas I didn't know prostitutes worked on their computers from home, but then again, you are a prime example of this.
2016-04-17	LOL! Isn't Trump's main bragging point that he's a great organizer and manager? Yet no one on his team understands how election rues work. He really hires the "best people" doesn't he?      I hope the whining child gets the nominaion. Watching him get demolished in the general election and helping the Dems with down-ballot voting will be both entertaining and beneficial at the same time. Go Trump!
2016-04-17	Actually it is that he isn't a savvy politician and he doesn't take outside money...so this makes him appear to be a martyr.
2016-04-17	Trump would hate having to actually serve as President. I hear he does like to win, though.
2016-04-17	Tammy McKinnon One more thing that makes his supporters feel like victims... victims of immigration... victims of religious persecution... victims of terrorists... now they're victims of the GOP.
2016-04-17	“The question is — and this is an important one — are we really going to be scared of the very things that have made our country great?” Clooney said. “We are not a country that is afraid and I refuse to accept that.”      refreshing sense of balance!
2016-04-17	Truly it does not matter. Hillary or Bernie Sanders The bottom line is what the dysfunctional GOP is offering even frightens the Republicans themselves. Whoever the Democratic nominee will be everyone will be unified far more quicker and far more stronger than the Candidates in the GOP. The reality is quite clear. From urination, hand size versus penis size, from whose wife is sleazier versus how many affairs did one have. Then it is fear and hatred with bigotry, racism and anti-semitism thrown in. This is no longer funny any more. This is what it is And right now the Democratic Party whether you like it or not has demonstrated that they are the adults in the room.
2016-04-17	$300,000+ bribes is a good balance? Word of advice. Pay attention to their actions, not their words.
2016-04-17	Neal Levine it does very much matter as we have 2 candidates in the Democratic Party that have very different values and each of them S president will work to lead us down different paths. I am always a democrat but will vote for the man that has integrity

2016-04-17	Blue all the way! Keep it clean! Let's work on campaign reform once we elect a blue senate and congress and president.
2016-04-17	Hillary Clinton is going to work on campaign finance reform? Holy shit, you guys really believe that? She owes her entire election to corrupt campaign finance. She couldn't get elected dog catcher without the support of billionaires and super pac.      Unbelievable you guys think Hillary wants to get rid of money in politics. Let me guess, you also think she is against the TPP?
2016-04-17	Funny, "blue did nothing about "reform" during the Obama's first two years, Juan

2016-04-17	Roy Ellis You should turn on spellcheck.
2016-04-17	The GOP has been peddling FEAR for years: Sharia law, your possum and squirrel gun taken away, your white women seduced by darkies of all races, communists over running the southern trailer parks, your marriage affected by some gay couple marrying in San Francisco when you're living in the Ozarks., etc., etc., etc.... The FEAR factor is endless...
2016-04-17	And what are the corporate Dems peddaling? Vote for us because you should be scared of the Republicans. Ignore our horrible trade policies, are horrible and unfair tax policies, or shady financing of our elections etc. Vote Blue because Republicans are Scary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2016-04-17	As a presidential candidate, Bernie would make a good comedian.
2016-04-17	I'm sure the big banks would like us to believe that it's some mysterious process to break them up. As though you have to go through the rigmarole of Dodd-Frank as opposed to straight antitrust proceedings or to pursue other violations of federal law.
2016-04-17	Do you think the current scotus will find for the banks if the legal system is used to force the breakup?
2016-04-17	Finally, we will start talking about how she has screwed american families and consumers with the Bankruptcy bill. Jesus! Took us long enough to start talking about that!
2016-04-17	Bryan Davis, you can't start talking about it until Bernie comes up with a single example. He has failed over and over to do so. He failed again today.
2016-04-17	Cheryl Onstad there is no single example. There never will be one because she is not that dumb. The reality is that she votes against the American family and for wall street everyt ime they are pitted against each other on a bill. BAPCPA, Foreclosure, Consumer Protection, again and again. She either votes with wall street or she does not vote.      THAT is the pattern and the issue. It has two explanations, either she is bought or she just really does not give a shit about the American family. Both are bad narratives for her.      Where the is smoke, there is usually fire.
2016-04-17	Bryan Davis ....evidently you punish your children just because you suspect they did something wrong ...what an ideal parent you are .
2016-04-17	This is a risky argument for him here in New York. Nearly 20% of our state tax income comes from the financial industry. I was having a rational discussion with friends last night, some of whom are Bernie supporters, and even they admitted that were he to win the Democratic nomination, he would have to accept big donor and PAC money in order to take on a Cruz or Trump in the general.
2016-04-17	one step at a time. there are plenty on wall street that support Sanders.
2016-04-17	PJ Smith   What % do you think?
2016-04-17	I think you're wrong. I and millions of other people have donated more times than ever to his campaign and, should the world be lucky enough that he is the Democrat candidate, I and millions of others will give more often and larger amounts than ever before.
2016-04-17	Ask her to show an instance when her vote - her influence, were not influenced by big money. It's a malaise of influence, rather than individual, specific votes.
2016-04-17	thats a loser argument from loser bernie and his supporters who are allergic to nuance. be honest. if you think hillary is corrupt by this logic, then obama must be too by your logic. and if you think obama hasnt fundamentally and significantly changed this country ina progressive way, you are uninformed and probably a useless ideologue.
2016-04-17	@Tom Church Obama made progress on race, but his record on the rest is dismal That includes Obamacare, which adopted the Heritage Foundation/Romneycare Republican model, which was a huge giveaway to the heatth care industry. Even HRC was for single payer in 1993-4; it was the right solution then and and still is now, if we are going to keep costs under control and still provide health care to all.
2016-04-17	Tom Church and so is Bernie. His other campaigns were traditionally financed. Not $27 at a time.
2016-04-17	Clinton 64 - sanders 31 here in delaware . This is Clinton's country .Go clinton . Bernie will be a disaster.
2016-04-17	Hey Bernie Bros, if money controls politics, then why is Bernie still not gaining traction in NY despite spending twice what Hillary has spent? Let me guess, "wah wah wah the establishment." The activist in chief did his job getting everyone riled up about some important issues, but now he needs to let the adult in the room solve the problems.
2016-04-17	Uh John you have not accumulated any delegates since your victory in Ohio...
2016-04-17	Joe Schmuccatelli yes he is surging in the polls. Out of 3 positions he is still in 3rd 4th in delegates behind Marco Rubio who already dropped out. Just like "Wayne's World this is Kasich's World.
2016-04-17	Ytap Gaspar Jaimes You can't really be this stupid-But then again,you are a Trump supporter-HAHAHAHA !!
2016-04-17	LOL. Guy picks up ZERO delegates in last month.
2016-04-17	The rule is ,50+1 at the convention, Over confidence and self loving has blinding Trump to reality ,He sees the crowds of fans , and says " o h wow , this is beautiful ,this is wonderful". he can't seee the millions who wish he would go back to being a bad game show host
2016-04-17	"Kasich: 'Winning is accumulating delegates' "      Translation: "Voters are chumps"
2016-04-17	Joe Schmuccatelli President Billary to you, trailer park girl!
2016-04-17	He serves a purpose in attracting those Republicans that don't have the stomach to vote for Cruz and would not vote otherwise. He's cutting into both the top two's plurality votes and that's a service he's providing. He'll go to the convention with a block of delegates to be the kingmaker if nothing else and for that its gold. The reason for a majority of delegates rule is to get the lead to modify their positions which would not happen if they followed Trump's a simple plurality. A majority assures a more unified party and Kasich is in the catbird seat if their is no clear winner. Its how the game is played.
2016-04-17	our livelyhoods should not be a "game". If this is how things work, then things need to change. We can't just thow up our hands and say oh-well-geez-thats-too-bad-my-vote-doesn't-count---time to do taxes.
2016-04-17	Shawn Starr If Kasich can't win at the convention the next best thing is to get his supporters a change in policies from the winner. Its the strategy of how business is done based on the situaton and also better for all in that it gets more support for the candidate instead of Kasich's people just going home disgruntled. Wheeling and dealing is the way all politics is done.
2016-04-17	A king maker?.....between a narcissistic crybaby tyrant & a wannabee Supreme Leader of the Christian Republic of America....chop off his head
2016-04-17	The only actual Republican still standing. Keep on trucking, John. Once it becomes clear that neither of the Nazis have enough delegates to win, anything can happen. Even the nomination of an actual Republican by the Republican Convention.
2016-04-17	OHIO's economic positions undet Governor Kasich since 2011:   In job growth 26th in nation   Personal Income 29th in the nation   Poverty rate 20th in nation   Jobs created 11th in the nation   Kasich, a former Lehman Brothers banker, living on the falicy that he turned Ohio around economically while in fact it is due to recent oil revenues that he had nothing to do with!
2016-04-17	Richard Flay We can't evaluate Kasich's claims based only on the information you provided. Where was Ohio before he became Governor in each of those rankings? While the state looks middling based on what you wrote, if it was consistently ranked in the 40s and 30s before he became Gov, then he has a point. As for the oil revenues, where were they before he became Gov? Did he implement policies that made it easier for oil companies to work and make a profit in Ohio? If so, then he is right to claim a share of that improvement.
2016-04-17	The RNC DOES have power...they are the national committee and can refuse to accept a state's delegates if they believe they have not been selected in a fair manner. The states can select whoever they want however they want...but at the end of the day, the RNC controls the national convention. The reason Colorado did not have a real vote is because the RNC said their delegates would have to be bound if they did.      But, it really doesn't matter WHAT the rules are or what the states say. Appearance is EVERYTHING and, this appears as if the will of the people is being denied, discounted and in...See More
2016-04-17	It is not a good idea to elect based on the will of the people,as the average person does not have the understanding to make good choices, in many cases. Representative government is much better.
2016-04-17	Lisa Mona But our representative government (Congress) DOES, in fact, reflect the will of the people. It is elitist to say that only certain persons may make these decisions...who are these delegates anyway? Are you aware that it is actually legal to bribe these delegates in order to secure their votes?
2016-04-17	Lorielle Sisson what you all don't seem to get is that the republican party is not a government entity governed by the voting process of the country.
2016-04-17	I Love how Priebus is acting like everything is fine! That's how the GOP has been functioning, act like they are doing the will of the people, but cater to a shrinking base! "Let the voters decide...", but they do everything to the opposite! They had a party autopsy and lo and behold, they have a front runner who nationalistic and exclusionary! So keep faking like you are doing the will of the people, but apparently they are tired of the impossible agendas put forth! You push an agenda that's impossible, and in turn you get a constituency that's impossible to please, and an unraveling party!
2016-04-17	He's dancing as fast as he can!
2016-04-17	Yes - no reason to insist on representing the will of the people, because that is a bad basis for government anyway. We need people who have expertise on issues to make decisions, as things are way too complicated for most people to have an informed opinion about them.      Donald Trump's popularity is an excellent case in point, although this was true way before he came around.
2016-04-17	The GOP has rules, but Trump does not like playing by the rules. He is a spoiled Rich man who wants his way. Wonders why conservatives give so much support for such a spoiled immature person?
2016-04-17	Priebus shouldn't feel that he has to comment every time the tRumpet runs his yap about how badly life treats him. He is a hot air bag, so just let him rant and ignore him.
2016-04-17	I agree - and furthermore, being ignored is the worst fate DT can envision for himself, as his reason for running is to be acknowledged, lauded and admired. In other words, he has a personal problem.
2016-04-17	Hope Prince Reibus enjoys the post mortem of the GOP, which he will be directly responsible for if Donald is denied the nomination!
2016-04-17	Trump has not gotten more than 37% of the popular vote. Than might indicate that 63% of the voters do not want him. ... so it will be left to the delegates to decide.      Also Trump's inability to master the delegate selection process may indicate his inability to master foreign policy. If Cruz is running circles around Trump what will Putin do to him?
2016-04-17	"Not even worth a response"   Kinda' like the questions about Benghazi and her illegal e-mail server. She's Hillary Clinton. She's above the law. How DARE ANYONE question her. After all. She has a vajajay and IT'S HER TURN !!!!!
2016-04-17	I'd say 11 hours ot testamony before a Congressional committee is a pretty good response. Serious adults don't engage in name calling because serious adults are results driven and name callling doesn't help one produce results. Hillary is a serious adult; Trump is a spoiled child.
2016-04-17	Leo T. Ward Her responses to questions were, smirks, chuckles and long pauses. What would you like for her interrogators to do, waterboard that skank? She's a Clinton. Clintons are above the law. But, you Clintonistas don't care. She has a vajajay and it's her turn.
2016-04-17	Leroy Jackson...she could have called him a thin skinned , bloviating, mysogonistic liar because that is what he is.
2016-04-17	Trump is uniting America against Trump. That is the only obvious trend. It won't be about Hillary soon. It will just be Trump or NO Trump.
2016-04-17	Well, Jimmy. That explains the millions of people, including Demorats and Independants, that are supporting Trump simply because they are sick and tired of professional, career politicians of both party's turning a deaf ear to the voters. Thanks to Obama for lighting the fire under these people. I'm not a Trump supporter, but if he wins the nomination he'll get my vote. If the GOPe ignores the will of the voters and nominate some linguini spined RINO that will bend over and spread their cheeks for Demorats then they'll be done as a political party once and for all. This is a peaceful revolution. The next step may not be so peaceful.

2016-04-17	Zindagi Rude Hai Lekin Hum Bhi Dude Hai You mean you're superdelegate rigged system out of the DNC?
2016-04-17	You're right - it is rigged. Trump gotten a mere 37% of the vote, and yet he's earned 45% of the pledged delegates.      In the interests of some amorphous concept of "fairness" Mr. Trump should released many of his delegates to vote for an actual Republican.

What part of "the head of the RNC's powerful rules committee has accused his own party leadership of a “major breach of trust” in trying to block a rule change" do you not understand? The head of the committee is one trying to change the rules.....not Preibus!      The Republican establishment is actually sticking with the rules!

2016-04-17	The nominating process has been rigged since 1790. Almost everything about party politics is rigged.
2016-04-17	This issue is clear as mud; I've only had a couple basic readthroughs on the rules change recommendation, but I'm getting steadily a bit more clearer about it. On one level, there's an attempt to shift the nomination directly to the delegates, and to remove any influence that the presiding officer would have, which would be a high-level party member. They're worried the party will intervene and rig the process such that the delegates have no choice but to abandon both Trump and Cruz; this isn't an idle worry, but it's an unlikely political move, because the optics of it will come at an enormous cost. On the flip side, I think the party is legitimately worried that if you give the delegates too much power over the preceedings, it will create nationally-televised chaos and gridlock. I'd have to look at the minutiae of detail to have a better sense, but I think changing the rules this close to the convention removes the one certainty in an already bitterly-contested situation.
2016-04-17	You nailed it.
2016-04-17	Chris Hall He sure did. Anyone who looks at that proposal and sees sense coiming out of that idea is kidding.      " The proposal, which is the brainchild of Solomon Yue, an RNC member from Oregon, would further empower delegates to determine the course of the convention’s proceedings — while diminishing the power of the convention’s presiding officer, a role that is expected to be filled by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Yue has said he’s looking to increase transparency by decreasing the influence of insiders."      Ok....but it also can create roadblocks that can slow down the convention as well and M...See More

2016-04-17	Priebus makes a good argument. He is saying that the convention rules should NOT be changed. He is saying that changing the rules could raise suspicions about attempts to influence the outcome of the convention.      Earlier Trump and his team complained about potential rule changes. Are they now complaining about the exact opposite? Are they now lobbying for rule changes? If you're the RNC, you're apparently damned if you do and damned if you don't.

2016-04-17	Nathan, so why are some of the 99 delegates Trump won in Florida called reserve delegates, actually the number is 30, which allows them to vote for a different candidate at the convention ? I watched the video many times, it's on YouTube, and Cory did nothing but try to protect Trump from an unidentified person who should not have been there approaching him at all.   Roland is correct in that Trump is very loyal to his employees and they are to him. Read a few books instead of Fox News and you will see many examples.

2016-04-18	Bernie likes the NRA swag too much.... kinda like he says he cares about Climate Change and Fossil Fuel use but after hypocritically attacking Clinton on those issues Bernie rented a private 767 jet to fly to Rome. "With a range of 6,408 miles on a full tank of gas, it can be calculated that a 767 like Sanders' flying 4,435 miles from New York to Rome uses approximately 16,596 gallons of fuel. The round-trip flight will use approximately 33,193 gallons. On average, an American flies only 7,500 miles per year, according to AmericanForests.org, 1,360 fewer miles than Sanders' round-trip Rome travel.      Thus, an average American releases less carbon emissions via aircraft each year than Sanders did in 24 hours. It's called being a hypocrite (and having a lot of really gullible young supporters who will believe anything you tell them).
2016-04-18	I take a different view. Bernie likes the Constitution too much, more than Gilibrand, more than Hillary. People like Gilibrand are contemptable. When you swear to defend the Constituion you swear to defend all of it, not just the parts you like or are comfortable with. Bernie understands this.
2016-04-18	In some place in your comment I think I will see you painting Sanders supporters as young. Let's hope HRCers' smug condescension disappear in November or you will make HRC have a hard time bringing us into her fold.      And, no, Sanders received a D- rating from NRA.      Every presidential candidate has private jets. Do you suggest Sanders to swim to the Vatican. Hillary got a jet; Bernie got a jet—but who is advocating for the most comprehensive climate change plan? Not Hillary.

2016-04-18	Stephanie Sommer Australian goverment bought the guns. Around $500 each. How much would it cost and how long would it take to buy or confiscate all the guns in the US? At the time of the gun ban, Australia had approximately 17 guns per 100 population. The US has more than one gun per person, approximately 300 millon by some estimates. Australia banned and purchased all semi-automatic rifles and pistols. Some say that the "majority" of guns sold in the US are semi-automatic. So, assuming we say half, that's around 150 million guns. At $500 each, it would cost the govenment $75 billion to buy th...See More

Fatherless black babies born into parentless vacuum with little of no hope for the future sucked into a life of gang violence and drugs. This is the direct result of FDR's polices and naturally instead of addressing the real problems the gultess pukes blame the gun. But leave it to Politico's own little garbage baby Glenn Thrusho try and leave you with the impression that "states like NY are "bullet-strafed" when in fact, the liberal run cites like Detroit and Chicago are in fact the the places that are "bullet-strafed".

Funny part is even if Trump wins all 95 delegates, he will have won 10 less than Cruz did in Texas. Trump is complaining because since Arizona, he has won a grand total of 7 delegates.

Nick Gass you should never use something as definitive.      A late polling shows Clinton vs Sanders 53% to 47% with a 2.9% margin of error currently, and since your article came out after the late poll, it shows your lack of journalism and the need to keep a false narrative going.

2016-04-18	The Trumps including Mini Trump Ted Cruz will go down in history not only for their hated and fear, bigotry, racism and anti-semitism, they will go down as destroying the GOP as we know it.

2016-04-18	Problem is that Trump is perceived as a republican when in fact he isn't.
2016-04-18	Trump's policies/platform are more "republican" than the rest of the gop field. Cruz and Kasich are proving themselves to be statist, not "conservative". Anyone who can support a party system where the "elite" make the candidate selections, will also support it at the national government level if it suits their purpose.
2016-04-18	Correct. Trump is an egomaniac seeking personal power for the sake of personal power. Dangerous.
2016-04-18	70% of Americans can see right through Trump, only 26% or so are incapable of figuring it out.

2016-04-18	First he and his family compare himself to god. Then it is Ronald Regan. Senator Lindsey Graham R-SC stated that the only reason why he endorsed Cruz was not because he liked him but loathed him. He endorsed Cruz because he felt with Cruz the Republicans would only loose the Presitdential elections. With Donald Trump they would loose the GOP. So far only 3 Senators have endorsed Ted Cruz/Mini Trump. What a joke.

2016-04-18	Calgary Rafael can't win the general election this is evident by not winning Ohio and his poor showing in N.Y. tomorrow. Calif. won't be any better for Rafael he can't win big states even Texas only gave him 47%. Calgary Rafael is a complete scam artist running around waiving a bible when in fact he is no christian at all just using it as a tool to fool folks. Good working relationship with congress Rafael can't even get along with his fellow senators today so he really makes up lies thinking people are so stupid to vote for him.
2016-04-18	Oh my the article title made me laugh out loud. For a moment I thought I was on the Onion.
2016-04-18	Let's expand a bit on Cruz's words:      "I'd have productive relationship with Congress where nearly everyone - including members of my own party - hate my guts".      Sorry Ted: We're not that stupid.
2016-04-18	Ted Cruz is the luckiest politician around. Lucky because of Trump.      Since he's running a strong 2nd to Trump, many beleive that if Trump hadn't run he'd have an easy path to the nomination.      NOT SO. Without Trump, Cruz would the the complete loony tune in the race. Not only has Trump's lunacy hidden Cruz's lunacy, but Trump has done the seemingly impossible: Made the hyper-radical Cruz seem mainstream. Before the campaign, NOBODY thought that possible.      Cruz would be long gone from this race without Trump making crazy him look good by comparison.
2016-04-18	Poor Bern doesn't get it. The Clinton Crime family owns this, DNC Debbie guarantees it.
2016-04-18	Just like they "owed" it vs 2-term Pres. Barack Obama? Yeah, riiiight...lolz.
2016-04-18	Boo hoo, Bernie, Boo Hoo! Bernie don't like New York NO MORE I guess him boasting that he would win New York last week was a bit premature LOLZ
2016-04-18	Tina Wolf The Clintons corrected their mistake by positioning their friends in positions of power. After CLinton left office they had few friends in office. They spent the 8 years between 2008 and today making sure they installed friends in the key positions and making sure they raised money for the superdelegatges so they could buy their loyalty.
2016-04-18	It's 'bad New York law' that members of the Democratic party come out to vote for their standard bearer?      Sanders admitted along the way that he used the Democratic party to his own ends. Now he complains that they didn't flock to him. Bernie should have run as an independant right from the start.
2016-04-18	There are a lot of us former Dems that have been brought back into the party bc of Sanders. The Dems have been moving to the right for decades. And we "real democrats" are demanding the party moves back towards the base. So there goes that premise.
2016-04-18	He knows he has no chance of winning but the money and donations for his campaign keeps pouring. As long as he can enjoy and earn alot from it, why stop?
2016-04-18	Why Aguilar True. Bernie might want to take another trip to Rome on his supporters' dimes.
2016-04-18	"These are elected officials, these are money people who are superdelegates" ... These are your colleagues Bernie and you are one of them!

2016-04-18	Mark Grueter   yap.. if one is perceptive.. you can s ee WHY he will never be able to govern IF he got elected Pressie.. and HOW he will meet with a very hostile Congress.. he will be legless in more ways than one IF he were President.. but of course, he says a lot of gbblegook when this query has been asked..
2016-04-18	And that congress, those colleagues, have an approval rating of 11 percent. Senator Sanders approval rating is 82 percent in his home state of Vermont. And your point is?
2016-04-18	#1 Bernie is a SuperDelegate.....#2 As the Nominee it's Bernie's job to get his people to vote for Clinton.....He sets the tone....but as usual he wants to sit on the bench.....do your job Bernie.
2016-04-18	once again.. I have already stated.. he is a lightweight on every level.. he is a back bencher.. he is no leader.. at this time.. he is simply running on bravado.. & sheer ego.. he's got a lot of that...   if he were a man of vision .. he would have run for Pres.. a long time ago when he was younger. he would have never been satisfied being a back bencher.
2016-04-18	Rafael Drumpf sounds like Trumps supporter, threaten violence if they do not get their way! This comment along loses me as a supporter!! Great Job, Bernie, keep stroking the flames!

2016-04-18	Bryan Davis - Pandering.
2016-04-18	Trump refusing to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and former Grand Wizard David Duke is the heart of his support. What he is doing is associating himself with ideas that were once politically taboo. The idea of encouraging Asian nations to get their own nuclear weapons so we can save a couple of bucks. This is all the stuff an extreme element in the country and in the GOP believe, but couldn't find anyone to mouth it. Well, Trump is and its the core of his followers where he's made it safe to say and think. He's far more than a donkey and the fascist who threatens violence as at his rallies and the GOP convention to get his demands met. Throughout history fascists have risen and when it was just words down played until their Brown Shirts acted. We've seen the White Supremacists at his rallies and they'll be at the convention.
2016-04-18	All I hear it white noise from you. The misrepresentations are getting old and they do NOTHING to harm Trump. Get something new to whine about.
2016-04-18	Lorielle Sisson I expect that's what you'd hear, no news there. The fact is Trump is a fasicst and like some until you see him marching down the streets in uniform along with his folowers you are in denial. If he was a Democrat instead you'd change your tune.
2016-04-18	Lorielle Sisson      Your comment is useless without an exmaple of a misinterpretation from Michael. Now, providing one of those would involve explaining and defending your comment. That'll be beyond you won't it?
2016-04-18	She recognizes Trump as a closeted democrat trying to hijack the GOP nomination.
2016-04-18	Trump would be a danagerous disgrace regardless of what party's nomination he ran for.

2016-04-18	Let's you know how badly our politicians are money compromised. They are protecting the system that's been in place for 35 years. At the least this shows the senators on the dem side who must be replaced.
2016-04-18	Hugh Johnson      Be careful what you wish for.
2016-04-18	Hugh Johnson You're right... He should run as an Independent... Stop that Primaries farce.
2016-04-18	Hugh Johnson Sanders has been fundraising and caucusing with Democrats for 20+ years. He remained independent because he's rightfully opposed to the two-party system that has gotten us tens of trillions of dollars in debt.
2016-04-18	And I don't think we will vote for "you" next time around. You see this is just the beginning of the revolution & we will not be voting for status quo politicians!
2016-04-18	This is the "end" of the revolution. The stupidity of the revolution was that it you tried to start it at the top....6 months before the primaries.....with ideas that won't fly in reality.
2016-04-18	I'm not sure the teaparty on the left movement has the legs to survive. You need true blue believers like the teaparty on the right has and the movement on the left are just in it for the kick they get out of believing they are badass in the establishments face and that is not going to hold up very well.
2016-04-18	Who you vote for and if you don't vote at all that is your constitutional right. I don't care if you vote for Sylvester the dam cat, Tweety Bird, or stay home. I will vote blue no matter what to stop these crazy insane Republican nut jobs from gaining any more power..especially the White House.
2016-04-18	The more this democratic primary drags on the more I hate Sanders, and his fanboys, trolls, garbage groupies, I would vote for Trump, its a lot easier to vote for someone I don't like over someone I hate, he's too old, doesn't know shit about national security and would tax everyone into poverty, thankfully he will see the grave before he ever sits his crusty ass in the WH..   Hillary is gonna. Crush him tomorrow..
2016-04-18	ditto

2016-04-18	And they think that he will have success after what the RNC has been doing THIS cycle?
2016-04-18	The RNC hasn't done anything differently than they have for years. It's just that Trump is whining like a little baby because his campaign was too ignorant to understand the rules and secure delegates. The rules have been in place for a long time and the other candidates seem to understand them. Trump is in the minority with his childish whining about the RNC and the rules they use to select a nominee. Also, the States all have different methods for choosing their delegates and those methods are not controlled by the RNC.      This wouldn't even be an issue except for the fact that Trump will not get the 1237 delegates and the nominee will be selected by the delegates at the convention using the balloting system. Trump knows that he will not win and therefore is attacking the process instead of admitting that he didn't do the work to secure tthe nomination.
2016-04-18	Jay Perkins The fact that arcane rules have existed for years makes it even more important to expose them to daylight. How do we (rank and file) Repubs want our candidates selected? Isn't that the most important question? I, for one, would like for our standardbearer to be determined by primary elections in each state. If a state decides to adopt winner-take-all rules the primary winner names the delegates. Period. If a state decides on proportional allocation of delegates the candidates split the delegates according to results of the primary election and name the delegates. Period. No backroom deals. Daylight, or as we Floridians say "Sunshine"!
2016-04-18	Jay Perkins   Agreed in addition      Trump curses at his opponents      and maligns them fouly      as if like a desperate fishwife      trying to sell her wares...See More

2016-04-18	Bernie's camp wants it both ways. Out of one side of their mouths they say their voters are not necessarily dem voters. Out of the other side they tell us their supporters will support other Dems. Which is it?

2016-04-18	Disqah Apax I really can't considering they didn't even vote for the liberal judge on the ballot and HRC is 2.4 million votes ahead but believe your delusions.
2016-04-18	Disqah Apax Sanders supporters are mainly attracted to Sanders' personality rather than any of his policies or plans.
2016-04-18	Downticket democrats owe Sanders squat until he campaigns for them or kicks back to the DNC.   He is useless to other democrat candidates, but has no problem running as one. We feel the bern all right--senator crazyhands has burned every loyal DNC member.
2016-04-18	Kicks back to DNC? Reducing politcal support to money is one of the illnesses of current politics. And why should Sanders support the DNC that tried to shut down Hillatry's opponents by having debates when the fewest viewers would watch? If Bernie is the nominee, I expect him to campaign hard for many senate and house candidates.   . . . Regardless who's the Democratic candidate, I expect unity between Hillary;'s and Bernie's supporters after the convention. They have enough time for uniting. What Hillary shouldn't do as nominee is walking back on the concrete promises she has given during her campaign - but then it would be her who breaks the unity.
2016-04-18	Perfect mentality and vocabulary to illustrate the problem. Money over voters.
2016-04-18	You are a good example of why the DNC needs to crash and burn. I will never give any money to that corrupt organization. You keep being the sheep that the DNC tells you to be.
2016-04-18	The liberal candidate who ran for the Wisconsin Supreme Court is not thanking Sanders. Joanne Kloppenburg lost to Rebecca Bradley, a far right justice appointed by Gov. Scott Walker.   Bradley got about 90,000 more votes in the election on April 5th. Sanders won the Democratic vote.   What will Sanders be able to do for Feingold that he didn't do for Kloppenburg?
2016-04-18	They ignored this though.
2016-04-18	I hadn't heard about this. What exactly was Kloppenburg's expectation towards Sanders, how did she coordinate with him?
2016-04-18	What happened was, the new voters checked off Sanders but didn't look farther down the ballot to pick other Democrats. They were just voting for Bernie.
2016-04-18	Show us the money, Devine, for All the Democratic candidates, not just Sanders. Show us the money! Talk is cheap. There are no dollars from Sanders that are trickling to the down ticket candidates that need it NOW.
2016-04-18	Do down ticket candidates need money, or votes?      I'd argue that Sanders' votes are worth more than Hillary's money.
2016-04-18	Tim Hoefling but you can't buy swag, coffe and finger sandwiches with a vote...... I am in it for the finger sandwiches.
2016-04-18	Tim Hoefling I think another poster made a good point that showing up to vote is not enough. They may just vote for Sanders and not look at other candidates on the ballot.

2016-04-18	If Hillary wins New York tomorrow... Will Bernie call it the deep south? Just like they called Ohio Nevada and Virginia. They say she's a regional candidate. Hmm
2016-04-18	It is true, however, the Sec. Clinton is leading based largely on support in states she won't win in November. While she won in Ohio and Virginia, two battleground states, most of her other important wins are in the South, which will vote red in the general election nomatter who the Republican nominee is.
2016-04-18	Jason Amato - Clinton already has the nomination locked up. Bernie and the media like to create ongoing drama to pretend he can somehow beat her delegate count. It would take a miracle from heaven to come close. Not happening.
2016-04-18	Jason Amato always some excuse.
2016-04-18	336 democrats though like really?!
2016-04-18	For a population the size of New York this is a sufficient sample size.
2016-04-18	Peter Fobian This was a national poll.
2016-04-18	Cheryl Onstad that's even worse.
2016-04-18	Sanders is the best candidate in the race. All polling clearly shows this. If the elections were today, he would beat every GOP candidate and Hillary would not.      ...and his popularity is rising as Hillary's falls.
2016-04-18	Unfortunately fo Bernie, nominees aren't selected using polls. Rather, he has has to win a majority of primary delegates. And that he cannot do.      He's run a great campaign, especially considering where he started. But polls don't win nominations or general elections.
2016-04-18	David Kent      The problem is Bernie is the best candidate now, after so many primaries are already over. Now we may get stuck with Hillary and lose the general.
2016-04-18	Buy a clue Tim. If the Republican thought Bernie was a threat they would already have started a negative campaign against him, like they have been conducting against Hillary for the last two years. They haven't for good reason and it is the reason why he is polling so good today.      Think a couple moves ahead and try to realize the reality of the situation even if doesn't fit your desired narrative.
2016-04-18	Hey Politico please read this and adjust your figures      http://www.huffingtonpost.com/.../clintons-delegate-lead...
2016-04-18	it is a blog which is blatantly anti Clinton, pro Sanders. Opinions don't count as votes.
2016-04-18	Charles Nichols....HuffPo includes delegates that have not been awarded yet. Bernie will pick up a substantial number of them, mostly from WA. That is why the numbers are different. Some reporting agencies are only reporting actual awarded delegates and others, like this HuffPo blog, assume Bernie gets these delegates, which he may, but they're not written in stone yet.
2016-04-18	Patty Nolte you pick your source of bias and I'll pick mine
2016-04-18	Someone has to teach Politico how nominees are nominated and how presidents are elected: State by state. National polls are useful only for writing inacurrate media stories like this one.
2016-04-18	National polls are useful to give a national picture of how the candidates are seen, and how the views change over time. Yes, election happen statewise, but candidates with larger national support win the national election, except in a few cases when the candidates were close.
2016-04-18	Sara Brightman - I would like to see Sanders as our nominee, but if Clinton is it, she should also be able to win against Trump and against Cruz. Kasich would be a problem for her but also for Sanders, because Kasich could play the favorable card against Clinton and the experience card against Bernie, but fortunately it looks like the Republicans are eager to loose in November.
2016-04-18	Ted, if god and Jesus want you to win, what's the problem? They will just pick you.
2016-04-18	Very sad that Jebus died on the cross for Ted and he yet he is failing Him . . . . .
2016-04-18	Senator Barry Goldwater stated in 1994 be very afraid that preachers are trying to take over the GOP. For politics and governing you need compromise. The problem with these religious people is that they believe their work comes and is for god and they will not compromise. I know I tried to work with them. Cruz's father and wife believe that Ted Cruz is destined by God to become president of the US, Like the second coming of Christ. Funny how Senator Barry Goldwater saw the writing on the wall years earlier.

2016-04-18	I'm having a great time watching Ted Cruz make the most of the moment that Jeb! and Trump have handed him. It took candidates that weak/obnoxious to give Cruz this time in the spotlight. Too bad for him (and good for the US) that he will be swamped by the Dems in the fall.
2016-04-18	Are you kidding? Cruz isn't even going to come anywhere close to the nomination. Donald Trump is going to be the republican candidate, and he is going to beat Clinton in this election.
2016-04-18	Dustin Arseneault exactly what are you basing that on? Poll after poll show Trump even more hated than clinton - and who thought that was possible?
2016-04-18	Dustin Arseneault It will be hard for Trump to win with GOP establishment voters sitting at home.
2016-04-18	they'll all run out and vote for Cruz whose "flat tax" is a big dodge to lower taxes on the wealthy      that's because they're all just interested in who's the biggest pile of feces

2016-04-18	LOL out of the mouths of babes. Ted Cruz is such a go to person for Jews. Sure. That is why he keeps the Reverand Mike Bickle's endorsement who is an anti-semite. http://www.timesofisrael.com/cruz-rejects-pastor-backers.../
2016-04-18	Sure the Jews are important to Cruz's faith. They got to keep Israel warm until the Rapture. *Then* they can get thrown in Everlasting Hell Fire for All Eternity.
2016-04-18	Amon Amarth that is why Cruz and his father cling to people like the Reverand Bickle.
2016-04-18	Amon Amarth Thanks for stating what you did. It's a strange Penecostal belief that is not Christian at all. The Cruz father and son do not believe that Jesus Christ died and was resurrected and gained salvation for all.
2016-04-18	Haha, the Dominionist King that wants to wage a war to take the riches of the non-believers(Jews) and return it to the Gentiles...and while he's at it, show America the 'Face of God' -give me a break.
2016-04-18	Rafael the Canadia could give two shits about the Jews. He just wants their votes.
2016-04-18	Cruz has a twisted view of Israel. His religious belief is that Israel must wage war in a final battle securing salvation which was not ensured through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.      Crazy.
2016-04-18	Yes he is surging in the polls. Still comes in 3rd place out of 3. But this is better. With 3 positions available his delegate count is 4th behind Marco Rubio. And yes he is surging in the polls so he says..

2016-04-18	I thought it was 47%, Mitt...I mean, Mark.
2016-04-18	Mark Traeger are you posting this nonsense on every thread? Those Americans get a break on their federal income taxes because of all the other taxes they pay. Is this a difficult concept for you?
2016-04-18	Mark is a hit and run troll who has been posting this exact BS all day long now. He refuses to put it in context because he is trying to trick gullible low-info types.      There are thousands of MILLIONAIRES who pay no income tax. Why would Mark leave out that fact?      (This is the 7th time I had to post this response because Mark just keeps posting this BS.)
2016-04-18	I just don't see how holding manufacturers of legal products liable for the illegal use of their product does anything but screw over the business.      What's next? Shall we hold car companies accountable because occasionally someone uses their car illegally as a weapon? Perhaps we should allow people to sue baseball bat manufacturers because bats can, and have been, illegally used as weapons in crimes?      It just doesn't make any sense. I'm a shotgun owning liberal, and I think handguns cause a lot more problems than they solve. That said, this is perhaps the dumbest solution I've seem come from the left.
2016-04-18	The main purpose of a car is not to kill but for transportation. The only purpose of a gun is to kill, so your argument is not that compelling
2016-04-18	It is a compelling argument. You just have to not be a pussy to understand it.
2016-04-18	Brian Loneske how many people in this country are dying of opiates. Let's go sue the drug manufacturers. They obviously are making too much product.
2016-04-18	So according to Devine, Sanders understands that gun violence is a terrible problem....he's just not willing to do anything about it......
2016-04-18	He's not willing to allow frivilous lawsuits that wouldn't stop gun violence at least.      Do you really not understand anything about what Sander's has supported? Are you just parroting what Hillary has told you to think?
2016-04-18	He's supported background checks (voted for them in 2013), ending straw man purchase, gun show loophole and for banning assault weapons. Stop characterizing him as not supporting common sense gun legislation.
2016-04-18	Olisa Maduegbuna      Hillary supporters are starting to get very tricky with their comments. They keep leaving out all the context that proves that their arguments are stupid, hoping that people are too gullible to know they are lying.
2016-04-18	All of Sanders No votes (5), on the great Brady Gun legislation belie his fake contrite views. Sandflea also voted No on the Amber Alert Bill and also the bill that allows raped women to find out if their rapists have AIDS or are HIV positive.   Sanders also voted No on gay marriage and then changed his views as Hillary did, however he attacks her for changing her views.   Sandbag has lost and needs to start supporting the Democrat candidate.
2016-04-18	Like the sandflea approach
2016-04-18	Hillaybros are out in force today. When will clinton repudiate this behavior?
2016-04-18	That's it?      I am sure you hillarybros can take more bills out of context in order to trick gullible people. Please try harder. You don't quite look desperate enough yet.
2016-04-18	The gun industry and gun sellers are the only business in America that is totally free of liability for their behavior. Nobody else is given that immunity. It's due to the 2005 law called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act which Senator Clinton voted against and Bernie Sanders voted for it.
2016-04-18	"The gun industry and gun sellers are the only business in America that is totally free of liability for their behavior."      Complete lie. They are not free of liability.
2016-04-18	Proof that you are wrong:      http://www.npr.org/.../fact-check-are-gun-makers-totally...
2016-04-18	Hope trump gets nailed

2016-04-18	sorry to dissapoint you; he won't; if anything Lewindowski can say she slanderd him by saying that he almost threw her to the ground and she caught her footing which didn't happen. she's a young idiot who couln't gain access to Trump that day and she is wrong.

2016-04-18	A GOP meeting descended into gun violence?      Well I'm shocked. I guess this is why they refused to allow guns at their convention eh? It isn't even the voters they are worried about! It's the other GOP officials!
2016-04-18	I think the NRA should disavow the GOP for not allowing guns at their convention.
2016-04-18	I'm buying extra popcorn for the GOP's WWE-style convention in Cleveland.
2016-04-18	Let;s get ready to FUMBLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE !!!!!!!

2016-04-18	that will NEVER vote republican. It's absurd that a state that never goes republican carries the influence of 95 delegates in the selection of a nominee. They should get three.
2016-04-18	Caption for picture above:      Miss Cruz: So your name is "Cox," huh? What if I did this with my fingers..?      Cox: Please stop that . . . . .
2016-04-18	The GOP always do this to themselves. From Donald Trump they want to give their party to Ted Cruz. From one idiot to another. You just can't fix stupid.
2016-04-18	Not a good campaign year for GOP so far. BTW, about Clinton accepting money from "Wall Street": it takes $ to win an election. Unless it's terrorists or David Duke, take the money. Obama spent $1-billion+. To me, Bernie refusing campaign contributions is just missed opportunity. PAV (Please Always Vote)
2016-04-18	Jim Robert Steel Trump has proven that you can do well without spending a lot of money. I think his major issue will be trying to turn around the negative publicity that he used, into something positive. Time will tell.
2016-04-18	Andrew Clear Should Trump win the nomination, he will quickly learn how hostile the liberal media is; if he doesn't raise near $1 billion dollar, he will be creamed by the Democrats.. which was most likely his plan all along. After all Trump hasn't changed his stripes, he just made a fool of the Trumptards that supported him by buying into all his bullsh*t.
2016-04-18	He only hates New York values when they give their money to other cons.
2016-04-18	So, after promising to "surround himself with great people- the best" Trump hired 3rd rate hack Lewandowski to run his campaign. After he ran things into the ground, Trump hires Manafort, who's last gig was running Russian Stooge Yanukovych's campaign (presumably for Putin) in Ukraine before he was ousted- and despite the fact that the US was against Yanukovych because he was a Putin puppet. And he also hired Wiley, who ran Walker's campaign for what- 2 weeks until he bailed?      You can't make this stuff up. Trump still dumpster diving for staff.

2016-04-18	So Trump is now relying on political "insiders" and "establishment" operatives to pull his ass out of the hole his "best people" got him into.
2016-04-18	Mike Elliot   Trump's going to have to work for it now. Will see how it goes. Sounds like recipe for internal contention, blame shifting, etc. At least he's cutting loose some money.
2016-04-18	Chris Snyder Internal Combustion, more appropriate.
2016-04-18	Mike Elliot "A bunch of "nobodies" have him #1 in the polls,"      I'd love to hear trump's reaction to that statement giving other people credit for anything he did. Trump's loudmouth and crass ideas got him where he is, but he has learned it takes more to for further.
2016-04-18	Brrrrawaahhawahahawawaaaa!!!! Really??!! Pedophile Clown fell for this??!! Manafort is going to spend all of Pedophile Clown's money and he's STILL going to get shafted at the convention..!!! Brrawaaahahawawaaahawawaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2016-04-18	If I were Pedophile Clown I'd be VERY cocaine-induced suspicious of this Manafort-guy. You need to ask him why he wants all your money, Pedophile Clown. And WATCH OUT!! He'll get a piece of Ivanka before YOU do.......!!!!
2016-04-18	Looks like we got a overly Eager Obama Voter here. Trying to find ways out of his grief of voting a Tyrant into office. The tears might pause for a moment, but they'll be back. Hang in there. #Trump2016 will save the mess Obama got us in.
2016-04-18	George Tedford just wondering - how have you lived under tyranny?
2016-04-18	Sanders has basically called Hillary corrupt his whole campaign. He is insinuating that she has been bought by special interest groups and when President she will pass bills and legislation that favor them and not the people. When asked to provide an example in which she did that Bernie couldn't. In my opinion Bernie has been running a negative campaign. He is dividing the party and providing Republicans with amunition to use again Hillary in the fall. We need to unite the party not divide it.
2016-04-18	You are 100% correct. And he has no right to divide OUR party when he has refused to help other Democrats & only just recently called himself a Democrat. He's a carpetbagger & he's destroying our party for his own huge ego.
2016-04-18	Telling the truth about Shillary Clinton is not insinuating. Look the word up in the dictionary the real problem is majority of Americans are not accustomed to a politician like Bernie Sanders that does nothing but speak the truth!
2016-04-18	Susy Coddington She gave speechs so therefore she must be corrupt. That is your idea of proof? Are you a Republican?
2016-04-18	This is frankly lots of chutzpah on the part of Sanders. They've spent the entire campaign demonizing Clinton's character and they are so upset when she fights back. Talk about elitist and thin skins. Sanders could hardly stand up to the Republican juggernaut if they can't take the gentle barbs Clinton has used in the effort to keep the party together. Please stop already.
2016-04-18	The only reason the GOP hasn't gone after him is because they haven't thought he would win. When they start, he will look at Hillary's camp with nostalgia.
2016-04-18	Bernie against Cruz or Trump!? I'd love those odds Bernie Sanders would win hands down!
2016-04-18	She wont release her records. She sells guns to countries *after* they donate millions to the Clinton Foundation, more so than we ever sold to them in the past. She helped to destroy the names of the 18 women (yep 18) that have accused Bill of sexual assault.      Sorry these are not GOP attacks, Hillary is not someone I want representing my party.
2016-04-18	Hillary Clinton is pure evil. She has no soul. She can look into the eyes of mothers and fathers and lie about the cause of their deaths without any human feeling at all. She will one day reap all she's sown. Karma is a bitch.
2016-04-18	*Karma* will hand Hillary the presidency. And you can whine for another eight years. :)
2016-04-18	Are you aware that there are 2 mothers, 1 wife, and the Ambassador's family all who completely dispute the 2 Fox led family members who repeat that lie. What, you are calling all of them liars and only believing the 2 who Fox caters to endlessly? There is a reason that mom who goes on Fox and screeches that Hillary murdered her son is not allowed to see her grandchildren...and it does not have a thing to do with Hillary. The dad who goes on Fox....claims that HRC and Obama sat there in real time looking at the murder of his son. Grief can do a lot of things to people but i will tell you what is worse...using 2 people to further your political agenda! Shame on you for repeating those endless talking points.
2016-04-18	Unfortunately you are absolutely correct
2016-04-18	another sanders liar ..... the comments were made to cnn by a republican operative ... it did not come from the clinton campaign ...... and now he's suing the clinton campaing for '''apparent'' illegal activity with fund raising .... bastard ..... he is trying to destroy the democratic party because he knows he will NEVER be the nominee .... i hope he gets sued for using campaign finances for his oh so ''personal'' stalking the pope trip .....

2016-04-18	Yeah. The confetti has turned to dust.
2016-04-18	Huh? The media responded to that win by a) still ignoring him b) when not ignoring him, saying he should drop out now even though he just won. In what world have you been living? If he got half as much free media as Trump I wonder how things might have turned out.

2016-04-18	Elizabeth Darlene Dear child; where on Earth did you get your information. Family health insurance three thousand per month and single coverage over one thousand dollars per month. These policies carry high deductibles. The unemployment rate is not reflect of what really is happening. Many college graduates are working at Mcdonalds part time because no jobs are available. Some individuals are working two to three part time jobs because that is all they can find. Many have stop looking for employment. The national debt has triple under obummer.. We have more racial divide in our nation since obummer took office. The corruption in Washington is at an all time high. He is spending billions of taxpayer's money lining his pockets. The list goes on. Get your head out of sand and WAKE UP!

Trump will bring back the good paying jobs to America. Trump will secure our borders. Trump will support our Veterans and law enforcemnt. It is a crying shame as to how they have been treated under obummer in the white house. If you want a free ride and don't want to work than yes vote democratic. If you want the corruption to continue and increase riots then by all means vote for your democratic criminal. America needs Trump. TRUMP 2016++

2016-04-18	Jon Gerber If you think you know what you are getting with Trump, you are easily fooled. The man changes positions often within hours, and would throw anyone under the bus in a heartbeat. He is epically unknowledgeable so good luck with thinking you know what you are getting.
2016-04-18	Trump, Rommey 216 lol.
2016-04-18	Kasich's name will never come up for nomination. Rule 40B, says you must win a majority of the votes in eight states. Kasich one. Trump and Cruz will keep the rule and expand it to all ballets because they will have 90% of the delegates on the rules committee. Kasich is hurting Cruz and waisting his own time.
2016-04-18	Actually that isn't true. That rule was in place for the 2012 convention, but is not one of the rules for the 2016 convention.      Another thing to note, the rule wasn't removed as some sort of plot against Trump. The rules were put in place at the beginning of the election cycle. Trump wasn't a concern then.      So no, the candidate does not need to win a majority of votes in eight states in order to win the nomination of the convention is contested.      This is misinformation that seems to keep getting passed along.      You can read more on it here: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/gop.../article/2586357
2016-04-18	Carl Hancock Cruz seems to think it will be in place, and I would guess he knows a lot more about it than you.
2016-04-18	Matt Edwards why in the world would assume that Cruz would know anything? He is a dunce.
2016-04-18	Hey Romney, here's an an innovative strategy to beat Trump: simply field *one* candidate that people like! That's all it takes! And it's the one thing the Republican Party couldn't do.
2016-04-18	Mitt is angling to be drafted in Cleveland and for a # of reasons he is the perfect choice for the GOP.
2016-04-18	That would make for a yuuugely entertaining convention. Must stock up on popcorn if that looks likely to be the script.
2016-04-18	"“I wrote this out,” Trump said, “And Its very close to my heart. Because I was down there, and I watched our police and our firemen down on 7-11..."      Well, 7-11 does have good coffee and their donuts are not that bad....
2016-04-18	Marcos Molina, or he was there on 7-11, a good two months before the attacks.

2016-04-18	lol
2016-04-18	lol - my favorite part: "Trump happened to see the state’s positive values reflected in himself. “And what are New York values? Honesty and straight talk,” he said."      that "happened" - nice touch lol
2016-04-18	This constant harping on the Cruz remark is making Trump look very local and very petty to the rest of America. If all he has on Cruz is an off the cuff remark, then he has nothing.
2016-04-18	he also has 2M+ votes on Cruz and counting
2016-04-18	He should have used a teletrumpter.
2016-04-18	Chickenshit Giuliani knows that if he endorses Trump not even a noun, a verb, and 9-11 will save him from the scorn of the GOP for decades to come...
2016-04-18	Giuliani and Trump are political twins. They both can be liberal, conservative, or moderate depending on whom they are speaking to....and both are incredible assholes, full time!
2016-04-18	Just the facts, 60% of the registered GOP support Trump in NY according to the latest polls. MOst of it comes from the bouroughs.An endorsement would help, but I think Giuliani's owners won't let him.
2016-04-18	Perfect description of this POS... Chickenshit
2016-04-18	I tried very hard to make a meaning of the reason he's not endorsing Trump and the only thing I came up with is that he's not sure Trump will be the nominee. Trump will win NY but someone else will be the nominee.

2016-04-19	Yes the word for Trump' s campaign is taint. Trump is not running to Make America Great, he is running to win the job as President without a clue what that even entails. I have lost respect for anyone supporting him.
2016-04-19	Wait................you only recently lost respect for Trump supporters?
2016-04-19	Explain how he doesn't know what president entails. From what I see Trump is the only one willing to defend the US with the urgency that it needs
2016-04-19	The Loud Trumpet is clearly the most unqualified presidential candidate ever to   appear on our national stage. More needs to be researched on his business dealings   and the nest egg with which he started. Very little he says can be believed and so   the need for independent sources is critical.
2016-04-19	I don't think I could even vote for someone who endorsed Trump & supported him. If he is the nominee, I would have to become an Independent as I don't want to be associated with someone like Trump.

2016-04-19	On the democratic side - it is actually more the 5th inning than the 7th. Wisconsin was exactly the halfway point. Given how NY democratic party set up rules that block new voters and hillary's depth and breadth of party and press connections anything less than a 15 point win does not bode well for her
2016-04-19	What are you talking about? Anything but a 20 point win by Sanders is essentially game over for his delegate chances.
2016-04-19	Robin, new voters could register up until the end of March. I'm sorry if Bernie didn't plan ahead. As to anything less than a +15 win not "boding well", please lay out the remaining states that Bernie will win by the necessary 60-40 margin to claim the pledged delegate lead.
2016-04-19	More like anything less than a forty point win for him and he is sunk. He has to win 80 % of the delegates from here. She could lose NY by 10 % and end up with more delegates then him Every single loss for Bernie or even a win by less than 40 % minimum takes out the few delegates left for him to make up any ground. She can lost out the rest of the way and beat him soundly.
2016-04-19	Yep, Hillary is in trouble. After today she's only going to be ahead by about 300 delegates so if Bernie wins the remaining states 80-20, he'll totally beat her. Good reporting.
2016-04-19	Michael Eisenberg....aint' that the truth? The media is determined to have a horse race even after the winner is cooling off in the barn.
2016-04-19	Cheryl Onstad Cooling off in the barn seems an appropriate place to keep the corrupt old nag
2016-04-19	Horse Puckey. Hillary is the most qualified candidate in the history of this country. She's not in trouble at all and even if she loses NY (which won't happen), she'll still coast to victory in June.      And no one on the other side can stop her from becoming our first woman president. Go Hillary!!!
2016-04-19	Heres the deal from NYC folks: Trump and Hill. Bernie will keep it closer than Hill would like and Kasich to come in 2nd. Thats all you need to know

2016-04-19	Sure, the hacks Hillary and Bill have given patronage to for decades will get the dupes out to vote.      If I were DeBlasio, I'd be more concerned about my own future. He's obviously anathema to NY conservatives or moderates - now he's managed to piss off the young liberals with his Hillary cheerleading. And he's presiding over a city that's in obvious decline.      I suspect the big loser from this close NY primary battle will be DeBlasio.
2016-04-19	People have said New York was in decline before and were wrong, so what makes you know so much more.   Except for Republican garbage, you don't really know Hillary's history of public service. Sanders and Trump have as much history as Sander's 2014 tax returns.
2016-04-19	@Jonathan Gelling so NYC is in decline just because the mayor endorsed Clinton that is so very stupid.   So Jonathan I expect that big loser from the NY primary battle will be Bernie Sanders. Mayor DeBlasio will be just fine. He has had his ups and downs, but mostly ups and NYC is doing just fine. Did you know that the crime rate in the city is at record lows.   I'm guessing you didn't know that Jonathan otherwise you wouldn't have made that comment about the mayor.
2016-04-19	I just love how these Bernie fanatics think. Wherever Bernie wins, it's because of "real Americans" and "the people," and a "movement" and "revolution." Wherever Clinton wins, it's because of "fraud" and the "establishment" people are "stupid" or "bought," and the places where she wins "don't matter." It's the intellectual power of a 6-year old.
2016-04-19	I'm going to vote later on today. I am taking several of my neighbors to our polling place. Oh BTW all of my neighbors are Clinton supporters.
2016-04-19	But...aren't huge rallies more meaningful? LOL
2016-04-19	Liz Villasenor How does that screw America? She's a moderate and her spending ideas are within the realm of Math possible, Sanders would be a waste of time, only ONE senator supports him..........that means he'd never come close to passing anything.
2016-04-19	Woo Hoo.. Thank you! Texas did our part. Happy New York is doing their part. Hillary 2016!
2016-04-19	Mayor you are so right time to put the non Democrat away.And for Clinton to be on her way to beat trump.

2016-04-19	Preibus has nothing to worry about because he said so. That is why he has been in the press on a daily basis saying the GOP process is fair. Now he has to talk with the House about the process itelf? There may be a problem that he is having to deal with. Its called the integrity of the GOP which is at stake now. Funny the GOP has been trying for the last 8 years to deligitimize President Obama and has failed. Ironically it hasn't taken that much time to deligitimize the GOP
2016-04-19	They did it to themselves - the only thing they achieved in the last 8 years.

2016-04-19	Yes Jonathan, how shameless. Pershap she can put the hot sauce on Trump's steaks. My understanding is that they're "the best."
2016-04-19	@Jonathan you must have missed the hot sauce bit. Clinton has talked about her love of hot sauce more then once over the years. Is that pandering no, Clinton just loves hot sauce.   The only one acting shamelessly is you Jonathan.

2016-04-19	both are self absorbed with a huge sense of entitlement
2016-04-19	“Is he going to try to support the party that is in favor of protecting voting rights"      What a joke, that's ridiculously hilarious. I'd write in Bernie before I'd vote for Hillary. Hahaha protect voting rights but restrict people from voting with strict 6 month registration grace period. "Protecting voting rights" is a insider joke to the Establishment.
2016-04-19	Each state makes their own voting rules. I beleive that only Democrats should be allowed to vote in Democrat Primaries. The NY rules were in place long before your candidate decided to run. They just didn't change because of Sanders. His campaign could have, and should have been aware of each states regulations. That is why they get the huge paychecks. So, don't go off complaining because you were not aware of the rules and think that now it is unfair because you or the campaign did not follow through. That is part of being an adult. So, suck it up and deal with it. Don't whin like a baby.
2016-04-19	Margie Vogel New York is the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party controls the state. Therefore you're wrong when the party that protects the vote doesn't. Republicans say to democrats look at New York as proof of their voter outreach. It's hypocrisy what the hell are you thinking?
2016-04-19	When are the uninformed ever going to start to understanding our system but if you believe that Bernie can deliver any of his promises it only illustrates how little you know about how things get done.      This is a PARTY PRIMARY and not the general election. Yah they're different. The party has their own set of rules and the state parties have their own set of rules. If you don't like the rules then don't run in the parties primary, its not complicated.

2016-04-19	I don't know how old you are, but many of the rules have been in place for years. Actually, many were initiated by our Founding Fathers. And, I think the party has been more than fair to Sander's who never wanted to become a Democrat until he decided to run for President and saw some benefit in it. Frankly, I think if he had the guts, he should of just ran as what he is, an Independant.
2016-04-19	Regina Woods of course I am aware that each state has their own set of rules but think just for a second just outside the box. they don't say a word when it is their preferred candidate but they opted not to say something about voter suppression in many states but.... why is that ?And you have to be aware the DNC and the state is connected big-time special money and interests play a role here.

2016-04-19	Nader is a convenient scapegoat for lazy, ignorant Democrats who can't do math - the 300,000 Florida Democrats who voted for Bush (as well as the failures of a candidate so weak he couldn't even win his home state of Tennessee) outnumber the 97,000 Florida voters that voted for Nader.
2016-04-19	Bernie Slanders and his Socialist Tea Party will destroy the DP if given the chance...They are a mirror image of the right wing Tea Party...McCarthyism and right wing talking points is all they have...
2016-04-19	Comparing the caring, passionate supporters I have met to the Tea Party and McCarthyism, when they're fighting for basic liberal tenets of affordable health care, education, and against income inequality, is ironic following a story of Sanders' supposed unfair attacks and lack of interest in uniting the party.
2016-04-19	Dave Buscema but I don't think some of them are fighting for those things anymore. If they were, you wouldn't hear things from Bernie supporters like " if he doesn't get the nomination going to write in his name or vote Republican". Statements like that prove winning is more important than voting rights, woman's rights, education, healthcare, income inequality, the climate and every other subject they claim to care about.   And they use the unfounded claims that the Sanders' campaign habe been making about her being a "corporate whore" and a bought politician. Yet they can't produce evidence ...See More

2016-04-19	Is that what you really want because remember, by the numbers more people have voted AGAINST Trump than for him.

The ONLY team suggesting that, would be one that hasn't really engaged in a sound campaign to begin with.   Running for the highest office in the world requires more than flying in slapping a few slogans around, engaging in wishful fantasy, and insulting those that are different than you. It's called WORK, studying substantive issues and facilitating wisdom to present a viable solution to the people & delegates.

2016-04-19	No, Rudy, Trump should get the nomination if delegates flip to him on a second or third vote to give him 1,237 delegates. Trump should ~not~ get the nomination of the delegates flip to Senator Cruz, which they will. Trump ran a great race for the first 2/3rds of the contest, then exposed who he really is in his corrupt deal making and willingness to say anything to try to pull in any group. Conservatives can't stand that, and many early voting delegates are sorry they supported him. ~Cruz~ should get the nomination. And he will get 1,237 delegates. Those are the rules. And frankly what Trump has done in the last couple months to disenfranchise conservatives shows the wisdom of how the rules are set up.
2016-04-19	I agree with everything you said except the characterization of Trump. He has exposed he is a whining, childish, boorish, spoiled wealthy jackass who thinks he is "special" and above following the rules like everyone else.
2016-04-19	Fuck off, either win over the people and earn the votes or stay the hell away from the White House. Your unlikable rat has failed to win over the hearts of the people. Failed to draw the huge crowds and the passion. You steal it and we will turn right back around and fuck you over in November
2016-04-19	That's fine. Independents like myself who plan to vote for Trump will stay home or vote 3rd party in the General Election and come January say hello to President Hillary. Cruz does _not_ have crossover appeal to independents like myself. That filthy goldman sachs slime bucket voted to fast track the TPP which will offshore millions more jobs, destroy U.S. sovereignty and nullify U.S. laws written by Congress. He also wrote the amendment to the gang of 8 bill which legalizes all illegal immigrants in this country. No way in hell i'd ever vote for that slimy piece of crap.

2016-04-19	Of course he did. King is a police state RINO who is all about centralizing power in the Federal government. King is the epitome of what is wrong with the system so hearing he voted for Kasich is not news. King hates all conservatives, especially the members of the Tea Party/Freedom Caucus in the House. No one, not even Democrats have attacked them more than King. He is a total POS.
2016-04-19	Why they keep voting for King is beyond me. The guy should be given the Mussolini treatment.
2016-04-19	Jeffrey Miller I'm a Democrat and I live in King's district. It's on Long Island, just outside NYC. He's a product of the county Republican machine there, the same operation that produced Senator Pothole, Alphonse D'Amato. The joke years ago was Tammy Hall didn't die, it became Republican and moved to the suburbs. He's safe no matter what he says or does. When the Dems last took control of Congress, he was the only Republican in congress from NY. And he NEVER does town halls.

2016-04-19	Still in high school, huh? Can't vote so keep those lame not-jokes to yourself. Cancer and killing is never funny and unlike Trumpeteers who care not one whit about truth and fact and his serial lies and supreme lack of knowledge, no matter who said it, it still wouldn't be funny. Sad that you love the immaturity. You'll make a terrible adult. Idiot. (Trump was the one who said he could go out and shoot someone and not lose a supporter. Hillary never made that dumbass comment.)
2016-04-19	Michele Lea Morin do I really look like I am in high school? Are you that much of a peasant faced rat? You support Hillary who is under investigation and is clearly guilty of what happened in Bengazhi. Also three people in my family have died of cancer, so yea I know what it does. So keep your pathetic attempt at being offended to someone who cares.
2016-04-19	Michele Lea Morin I'm not Brandon nor do I know him personally but first off: Cancer has become slang for rapid spready of toxic comments or movements, because of the way the bias is here, he has likened it to cancer due to how the commenters themselves. Second off, ad hominem is terrible and you're clearly making an ass of yourself for indulging in it. Third off, he evidently has knowledge, as evidenced by this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ie4Z56Z1LY he's indulging in basic speech to appeal to the masses. You try and use intelligent language? You go the way of Rand Paul, or Carson. Fourth off, Trump said that quote to give a picture of how rapidly his success was growing. Brandon mentioned his statement to give a picture of the political bias here.

2016-04-19	I noted that those caucus states that Sanders has been crowing about had record low turnouts and yet he says he does better with high turnouts. Well we know that is not true.   NY is suppose to have a very high turnout and yes most people in NY says that helps Clinton not Sanders even though he has been saying the opposite in his speech's.   We shall see won't we. I am voting tonight with several of my neighbors all, but one is voting for Clinton. The one is voting for Trump, but most of my neighbors consider that neighbor nuts. Makes sense she is voting for Trump. She thinks that the Drudge Report is all about truth. Everytime she says that to me I just laugh a lot.
2016-04-19	It is in fact untrue that democratic caucuses have had record low turnouts. They are in fact higher - as a percentage, even - than 2000 and 2004.
2016-04-19	Nick Salazer-Reid caucus system is undemocratic. These format favors people who are well off and don't have fixed job schedule. These format also encourages bullying and remove the keystone of a democracy, namely, anonymous voting.      Sanders benifited from undemocratic system, and has the galls to attack the "rigged system". It is rigged alright, in his favor.
2016-04-19	Nick Salazer-Reid What is true is that caucuses have much lower turnout than primaries. That was the point. Yes, turnout in many of the caucuses beat turnout in prior years, but there are many more people voting in primaries than in caucuses.
2016-04-19	Sanders lies a lot.      Politicians lie a lot.      But Sanders is supposed to be different.
2016-04-19	Daryl Outterridge You can start with the whopper this article is talking about, BernieBot. I can add the one about where the Vatican invited him to meet with the Pope last week.
2016-04-19	Daryl Outterridge All his Policy is based on false math, as discovered by CNN, PBS, NPR, ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC............so yeah, it's all a lie. The media, and the DNC say his math does not remotely add up. His policy ideas are based on a 5.5% GDP growth, which is pure fantasy, therefore, his taxes don't add up to paying for any of his ideas. The "Billionaire" class couldn't pay for his ideas even if you taxed them at 200%.
2016-04-19	Politicians that tell the truth don't get elected. Bernie has been elected in the past, therefore Bernie has mostly likely stretched the truth a time or two.
2016-04-19	He's trying to get his supporters to vote. Should he tell them his campaign does better when people don't show up to vote for him?
2016-04-19	He should be trying to tell the whole truth no matter what.

2016-04-19	BERNIE HAS STARTED TO LIE WORSE THAN ANY CHEAP REPUBLICAN.
2016-04-19	Eileen Shaeffer and you have been lying here for weeks.
2016-04-19	Politifact is putting out FALSE information. For both of the two outliers that Politifact relies on to make up their claim: Washington State and Utah, Politifact screws up.      Washington State was only down 5.69% from the record high of 2008. Politifact claims that turnout was down by a ridiculous ~69%. Which is complete bullshit.      "Eight years ago, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama drew 246,000 Washington Democrats, about 14,000 more than Saturday’s contest."   http://www.opb.org/.../washingtons-caucus-voter-turnout.../      Utah was down because the state switched their system from a primary to a caucus. So, Politifact tries to compare apples and oranges, here.
2016-04-19	Richard Anthony "..the average turnout rate for a state Clinton carried is 44 percent, while the average turnout for a Sanders victory is just 31 percent.."      Discuss.
2016-04-19	To be fair. I do think Hillary would be a PC and Bernie a Mac.
2016-04-19	You're expecting a lot of calls to tech support if she's elected? :-)
2016-04-19	Sorry but Bernie would be an old fashioned typewriter.
2016-04-19	I see it the other way. Apple = style, PC = substance. Also, PC is far more community oriented as a hardware platform, despite Micro$oft's best efforts to make it just like Apple.

2016-04-19	Please what a bunch of whiners. It's a Democratic Party Primary not a Independent Party Primary. Form your own party!
2016-04-19	The idea is to vote for who the hell they believe should be president, not close it off because one just happens not to be a Dem or Repub. This is an affront to democracy and to suggest otherwise is advocating for a broken, false 'choice', two party system.      Humanity is complex and our system is too overly simple. Our beliefs vary all over the place, NOT just 'Democrat' or 'Republican'. The fact you could even support that mean you and others can be the ones to blame should Hilliary lose in the general.
2016-04-19	Ron Crone Take a civics/history/political science class. Parties are independent organizations, not governmental entities. Like James said, if you don't like it, start your own party. Or, better yet, get involved more than every time somebody makes a bunch of promises you like.
2016-04-19	Well, then stop taking state and Federal tax dollars to conduct your primary. If we need our own party, you should raise your own money. And forget about using public schools for polls- taxpayers of all parties pay for those, too.
2016-04-19	They are called PARTY primaries for a reason. Each state gets to make its own rules and any one of you could have registered as Democrats at the proper time.
2016-04-19	It was a 6 month deadline. Nowhere in the country does a state have that ridiculous deadline but in New York.      Besides, if you truly supported a democracy, everyone should vote for whoever the hell they want regardless of party affiliation. That's what a DEMOCRACY is      A broken two party system in which doesn't fit the bill to how overly complex and varied our society is. To advocate for this is to oppose what democracy is.
2016-04-19	Ron Crone We live in a R-E-P-U-B-L-I-C, not a Democracy! #MakeAmericaSmartAgain
2016-04-19	Ron Crone And? You were still able to know the deadline, act before the deadline, etc.      In addition, perhaps you don't understand the subject. This is an election whereby PARY MEMBERS vote to decide who their standard bearer will be. Independents don't deserve special attention during these elections. If a party decides that they will only allow party members to vote, then you have two choices...1) register as a member of that party in time to vote in the primary for that state or 2) stay unafiliated and vote for the choices that party members put up for vote.      You may not like that system and of course you can fight to change it. But as of today, April 19....that is the system.      Hugh Johnson....6 months. You had to register by October.
2016-04-19	Reach for that last straw Burnice.

2016-04-19	OK then, Bernie, as a Democrat you can work from inside the party to change rules you find unfair. Oh, wait, you're not a Democrat.
2016-04-19	like your comment
2016-04-19	Good one, Caroline!
2016-04-19	His policies match up with most Americans and is seen as more progressive than any 'Democrat' (social issues is a given, so don't bother with that).      Democracy is voting for whoever who damn well want, regardless of party affiliation. This 'false choice' system of a D or R is the problem as most don't even identify with either. Humanity is far more complex than that.      These comments here seem to be more indicative of the everlasting problem of our 'democracy'. If everyone supported it, we wouldn't limit who we can vote for, rather based on who we feel to be more in line with the American people, aka. Bernie Sanders.
2016-04-19	Once I talk to Mr. Trump and once he okays and once I talk to the NRA and they okay it and once Jesus appears in my house and He okays it then I'll be getting back to you for the remainder of my 15 minutes of fame. In other words, she has no plans to ever get back to you.
2016-04-19	Cruz is probably doing exactly what she is saying he is doing. Trouble is, that is how Politics works! And someone should have told Donald Trump that before he started. Never seen a more inept, dishevelled, dysfunctional bunch of whining losers.   Trump has only himself to blame, though, he picked them.

2016-04-19	I hate Trump and am a Cruz supporter but you cant say that with a straight face druggy as Osama Obama has been the biggest cry baby ever...Every day bitching about how he is treated unfairly...Cant wait for Osama Obama to go away and stfu once and for all.
2016-04-19	Brian Kourdou Do you have any examples of Obama whinning?
2016-04-19	Ray Thompson Doubt it, he's a Cruz supporter all they know how to do is parrot whatever he tells them:)
2016-04-19	Does anyone from Trump's campaign watch House of Cards??? ;) I'd bet a kidney Trump has a Politics for Dummies book in his limo.
2016-04-19	His limo is actually called politics for dummies.
2016-04-19	Joshua Eldridge well he will be the next PRESIDENT so get used To calling him MR. PRESIDENT!!!!!
2016-04-19	Donald G Kintz Unlikely, there's no way he'll get enough women and monority voters. But still, it's fun to dream isn't it?!!!
2016-04-19	The idea of Ted Cruz bribing anybody is ludicrous. His whole campaign is based on the idea that he's NOT that guy. If Trump really were bribing delegates, nobody should be surprised. If Cruz did it would be the end of the campaign, which of course is why they are accusing him of doing it.
2016-04-19	You CAN'T TRUST TED
2016-04-19	And the idea that he is not is just as ludicrous. Everything that has happened this election cycle has been underhanded games and lies. Not just by Ted, but by all.
2016-04-19	As much as I hate Trump, I do think that was just a slip-up. I'm sure they are all mentally worn out by now.
2016-04-19	Mentally defective is more like it.
2016-04-19	I agree that it was a slip of the tongue. It is a little funny, though.
2016-04-19	Daniel Warren Curtis , If you HATE Trump, most may want it used against him, if you Love Trump, it's no biggy..... but I am aCruz supporter and know it was a slip...still, I'd like it to hurt him, yes.....but it won't much if at all, probably.
2016-04-19	I'm sorry. A slip on an issue of that importance is not acceptable.
2016-04-19	Please tell me you are not a professor at UOM and only a student! Seriously?
2016-04-19	David Bradford , who cares about that...but what I DO care about is that Trump took Cruz's comment about New York Values and used 9/11 to attack Cruz with...and you all bought it...when anyone with a gnats brain knows he was NOT referring to the First Responders. Cruz messed up when Donald started in on that little 'Speech, which someone else could have written for him beforehand to say,.... but Cruz SHOULD have broken in and put his hand up and said, "Donald, STOP IT RIGHT THERE"..... but Trump was using this 'practiced reverant tone'...so Cruz politiely stood back and let him run his big mouth...... Cruz's big mistake....

2016-04-19	With all the Kocch brothers et al money, expect to see thousands of false campaign ads. The GOP cannot win honestly so they lie, cheat, and steal to win elections with false ads, unlimited, usually anonymous, campaign spending, GOP 5-1 elections-rigging gerrymandering, and the GOP's nationwide voter suppression efforts nationwide in 18 states.

2016-04-19	"In 2009 when medical marijuana took effect, about 10 percent of all our traffic fatalities were marijuana related," Tom Gorman, director of Rocky Mountain HIDTA said. "Now it's 19 percent. You'd have to be in total denial to say this is not related to legalizing marijuana. More people are going to use marijuana, and because of that you're going to have an upward trend in all these areas."
2016-04-19	Colorado alcohol related fatalities: 39%      Mr Gorman fails to mention that they are testing for matabolites, not inebriation. Matabolites can linger in the system for weeks. All the tests show is that the victim used marijuana in a range of days and weeks. If you had a martini on Monday then had a car accident Friday was the martini at fault?      No one is advocating being anything less than 100% sober when driving.
2016-04-19	These are reports by members from a very biased federal program, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program.      The Rocky Mountain HIDTA does not mention their conflict of interest, that in time they stand to lose a very large share of their funding with the legalization of cannabis. Once again their annual report should be considered nothing but propaganda.      "This report will cite datasets with terms such as “marijuana-related ”or“ tested positive for marijuana.” that does not necessarily prove that marijuana was the cause of the incident" -Rocky Mountain HIDTA, 2015.      2015:      "Supposedl...See More
2016-04-19	Removing the stigma associated with marijuana use is not a good thing.
2016-04-19	Why?
2016-04-19	Curtis Haines Because stigma is one way to discourage marijuana use.
2016-04-19	Daniel Warren Curtis I think the last 60 years of prohibition contradicts your statement
2016-04-19	POSSIBLY involved?? WTF does that even mean?? You cannot OD on it. You can have too much and feel pretty lousy... but no hangovers!
2016-04-19	True statement.
2016-04-19	Bad article! Why did mj users go to the ER? Were they 1st time users that got paranoid? There is no other reason I can think of.
2016-04-19	Agreed.
2016-04-19	It doesn't even say if they went to the ER because of cannabis, only that they admitted to using cannabis to the ER doctor, or that the visit "possibly involved exposure to marijuana"

2016-04-19	So Cruz loses PA, DE, RI, NJ and MD. But we are prepared is Cruz mantra. The man is a joke. He can't win based on what the voters want. Soooo Cruz wants to steal it with the establishment bought and paid for by lobbyists and corporations of special interests. Cruz "the ESTABLISHMENT POLITICIAN".
2016-04-19	Republicans who have been warming to Cruz because he has been winning will cool off quickly when they see just how disliked he is in the larger,, eastern States. Cruz is nothing more than a trouble making snake oil salesman.
2016-04-19	But Trump followed Cruz with only a 17% gap and took delegates...Trump followed Kasich by only 11% and Cruz a distant third. NY is a blowout and Cruz is a very distant third...and probably ZERO delegates. They can try to spin this, but we all know he is in for a rough ride - PA, DE, RI, NJ, MD...
2016-04-19	I used to watch Fox. Now, they are no more than a Super PAC, esp Fox & Friends, Bolling, and Hannity. Refuse to watch at all anymore.
2016-04-19	I agree. I spend more time on Netflix, these days. Although, I still try to catch Megyn and, sometimes, Anderson Cooper. I will never watch Hannity, FOX and friends or Morning Blow, again.
2016-04-19	I cancelled my dish subscription because of how awful FOX had become. It was my only news cable and it has basically turned into TRUMP News.
2016-04-19	Richard Joseph My viewing habits exactly.
2016-04-19	And the rest of the time, they are talking about him, complete with reruns.
2016-04-19	POLITICO just mad because in an interview with Fox an Friends this morning, Trump said your publication was a "failing one" and you write factual articles regarding his camaign and "fail to call him."
2016-04-19	well that wasnt worth posting was it? as if politico wont out live trump in terms of being seen by milions daily. in 6 mos trump will be the laughingstock he always was and further have gained the title of biggest loser in recent electoral elections. i hope you are not defending that vacuum of a man
2016-04-19	Trump says that about every media outlet that doesn't fawn all over him.
2016-04-19	Lynne Polelle which he has also been doing since the 1970s.
2016-04-19	Cruz and surrogates are too busy trying to get delegates in closed meeteings to bother with a message for the America people.
2016-04-19	Oh you mean actually trying to *win* the Nomination rather than seeing how much time he can spend hearing himself talk, or getting verbal blowjobs from Hannity?
2016-04-19	i loathe cruz but its called knowing the rules to the game. trump is always blowing about how clever and effective he is and yet he was taken by surprise over rules given to his team a yr ago. laziest man to ever run
2016-04-19	Jim Morris being 300 delegates and over 2 million votes down maybe Cruz's "winning" strategy is more a "getting my ass kicked" strategy. Turms out Republican voters dont like corruption.
2016-04-19	I can't stand that liar Trump and now I refuse to watch FOX. I keep thinking O'Reilly and Hannity are going to go to their knees when Trump is on. Both continue to allow Drumph to lie and never correct him for making a stupid statement, but instead they cover up for him. Dump FOX and Drumph.
2016-04-19	You obviously have not watched as O'Reilly "interviews"/argues with Trump about some of his proposals.
2016-04-19	The well has been poisoned for a long time just as the people of #flint . As much as we want ot lay all the blame on Snyder the #flintwatercrisis could not have happened without democrats covering it up.
2016-04-19	David Smith COMPLETE LIE. The only entity that covered up anything was the Snyder administration. No one else had any power in the situation after Snyder appointed an emergency manager, who...along with members of the Snyder admin, made the decision to switch to Flint River water.      Snyder's own task force put most of the blame on the State. You should educate yourself first and post second.

2016-04-19	Larry Noble is slightly baised as he has come out in support of Sanders yes I checked. The funny thing is that the Sanders campaign is doing this wrong they were suppose to send complaint to the FEC not the DNC or the media.   Both CNN and MSNBC agreed that Sanders is doing it this way so that they can get people to vote for them in NY and that Sanders has zero case.   That Sanders also signed this same agreement, but in his case he is not helping any down ballot Democrats unless they pass his purity test as in they have to support him.   Clinton on the other hand has no purity test this money goes to all Democrats down ballot.
2016-04-19	The part about Clinton having no purity test is spot on as long as the money ends up in her pocket .
2016-04-19	Murray Gray your so stupid the Victory Fund has been going on for awhile and yes the money is going down ballot and no test is being applied to Democrats and yes they get the money.   Sanders will only give to Democrats down ballot who support him and we are not talking about a lot of money compared to what Clinton is giving to the down ballot Democrats. Millions to a couple of thousands does not compare considering how much money it takes to run a race.   Sanders says this is a revolution the last time I checked it's suppose to mean more then one person. As in not just Sanders. With just one person there is no revolution.
2016-04-19	One never has to defend honesty and integrity. It's never in the gray area, Hillary.

2016-04-19	I see Trump is using code word now and changed violence to turmoil if he doesn't win. His supporters would vote for Ryan if you spelled out his name and wrote it down on a piece of paper so they could take into the polling booth. Without that I agree with Trump they'd just get confused.
2016-04-19	"Riots" was the word he used before.
2016-04-19	John P. Herling I think in the very beginning it was violence, but riots too.

2016-04-19	yeahhh....
2016-04-19	Really ashamed for my county. Looks like more people here voted for Trump. There almost isn't any way I can see anyone vote for Trump if they aren't a bit racist after all he's said and his past.   http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trumps-ex-wife-once...      And misogynist given his comments referencing Megan Kelly's cycle, and Fiorina's face, his pregnancy comment letting the guy off the hook, and the other countless ways he treats women who cross his path and that are not his fawns. Goodness New York!?? At least where were the self respecting women voters?      Plus not too bright either to see that those ideas are not workable especially the trade ones. Hopefully Drumpfs candidacy ends in Nov if not in June or we'll all be back to the gnashing of teeth and suffering we were all experiencing by the end of 2008 or worse.

Todd Starnes      I don't seem to recall the Mainstream Media or the Conservative pundits expressing as much excitement when Cruz won Texas -- as they did when Trump won New York.   And just for a bit of perspective -- for the MSM and the pundits who say Cruz is now doomed....   Cruz got more than 1.2 million votes in his Texas victory. Trump got more than 400,000 votes in his New York victory. (Note: Trump's numbers may go up - votes still being counted.)
2016-04-19	If only we could fast forward to November and feast upon the salty, sweet nectar of Trump supporter tears.      Nothing is so nourishing to a secure, healthy person as a racist's grief.

2016-04-19	Yeah - F' "the people" - all hail the Party, right, comrade?
2016-04-19	I'm glad to hear your enthusiasm for feasting upon "salty, sweet" bodily fluids. The best of luck to you getting out of that one.
2016-04-19	I think the polls show what the people think. Regardless of who you support, you should exit the race if you don't have a path to 1237.
2016-04-19	And the GOP should consider Obama's SCOTUS picks, but the GOP establishment plays dirty

2016-04-19	Bri Kau thats why i want the "establishment" rinsed...starting with reince!!!
2016-04-19	The only logical reason to support Trump is having so much rage against America for failing you in things such as:      - Having elected a Black president TWICE      - The Mexicans next door got a new car AND your daughters have the hots for the boys.      Revenge takes over reason. It blinds you and you want to punish her so bad ...

2016-04-19	Hey, if you wanted to declare yourself "independent" of the political parties, then you shouldn't be trying to meddle in their affairs, should you?
2016-04-19	Due to their size and power the affairs of both the Republican and Democratic parties are de facto the affairs of every single American.
2016-04-19	you guys aren't big on reading comprehension much, are you? long term registered party members are complaining about this mess. i know several people who found their registrations changed.

2016-04-19	Lots of funerals not to attend. I'll only be sending good riddaance notes.
2016-04-19	New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer filed a letter Tuesday to Michael Ryan, executive director of the city’s Board of Elections, announcing an audit “to identify failings and make recommendations to improve performance going forward”      Then De Blazio says... New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also called on the city Board of Elections to reverse a voter purge that removed voters from voting lists and announced his support for the audit to be completed this summer ahead of New York’s June 28 federal primary “so corrective action can be taken.”      This whole thing smells dirty to me.
2016-04-19	Bill didn't call on the Board to reverse anything. He wants an investigation for why so many Democrats were removed from the registration list. He also wants a solution so people can be warned prior to the Nov Election in case they have to register again.   http://www.wnyc.org/.../de-blasio-demands-explanation.../
2016-04-19	Sounds like a plot by the Bernie bros to steal this election.
2016-04-19	Peter Jones Sounds like a fake account moron with a stupid opinion.
2016-04-19	Not sure I get it, many states do not allow non-party members to pick the person who runs. This is not news to most consistent voters.
2016-04-19	Over 126,000 voters were purged from the lists. How would you feel if you went to vote and...oops...your name had been removed from the list...?
2016-04-19	Baruch Zeichner that number is complete bs. No one has a clue. Stop the nonsense
2016-04-19	Baruch Zeichner - If I found my name had been removed, I would cast an affidavit ballot. Yes, I would be upset, but I'd still vote. On the other hand, since it is a closed primary, I'd have to be really stupid to think I could vote if I wasn't a registered member of the party whose primary I wanted to vote in.
2016-04-19	Where are all the libs whining about the party in power blocking people from voting?
2016-04-19	Michael, your party has priors for this crap!
2016-04-19	Baruch, Hillary is a democrat, not a lying corrupt Republican! Regardless of whether you support Hillary or Bernie, keep these lying, corrupt & incompetent Republicans scumbags out of the White House. They cannot even be trusted with a single deligates election, let alone handing over the White House. Surely 8 years under Bush/Cheney taught you something???

2016-04-19	Props to Warren.
2016-04-19	Hillary Assad gfys
2016-04-19	props for what? having a big mouth? At least Cruz is in the ring, fighting.
2016-04-19	Hillary Assad A Dynasty is three, got it? I bet you voted for GW Bush and never said a word a about "dynasty".      Remeber, two is not a dynasty. K?
2016-04-19	I don't know, frankly running for president looks pretty grueling. Days starting at the crack of dawn, criss-crossing states by plane or bus with 7 or 8 events a day, with media vultures and social media vipers looking to take even one word you say out of context.      I'm sure a lot of the people Warren is screeching about don't have anything like the kind of work ethic that takes.
2016-04-19	Jonathan Gelling....you forgot to mention they're criss crossing states on other people's dimes. How awful for them. Much easier to figure out how to put food on the table and a roof over your kids' heads. *eyeroll*
2016-04-19	Cheryl Onstad Yes, it is much easier for the vast majority of people to do that. That's why few people run for president while hundreds of millions find jobs.
2016-04-19	Cheryl Onstad that is the only thing warren agrees with, doing it on someone else's dime.
2016-04-19	Grow a pair and endorse Bernie.
2016-04-19	Why?
2016-04-19	Gork, Elizabeth Warren has more leverage if she endorses no one.
2016-04-19	Terry Underwood She'll endorse when it's time to unify the party.
2016-04-19	This is the kind of person we need to run for President. Why won't she?
2016-04-19	Her tribe won't let her.
2016-04-19	.....And her vice presidential running mate should be Rachel Dolezal ex NAACP leader who claimed to be black but was outed as
2016-04-19	because she would never pass muster
2016-04-19	Lizzie go back to making your moccasins. You speak with forked tongue.
2016-04-19	Can't even spell 'Sanchez' on your (ho ho) 'Profile'...hmm...Troll Reveal.

2016-04-19	SH is a jerk. Always has been. He feels he is much more relevent than he really is. He and Mica on msnbc along with JS are all cut from the same cloth.
2016-04-19	I suspect the three are having a contest to see who gets to service the Donald, first, in the Oval office.
2016-04-19	Blind old man. No one wants to live in your corporate theocracy. Nationalism is the only way our people still survive. Wake up!
2016-04-19	Jason Hanwel, I like sarcasm.
2016-04-19	Nobody who knows Cruz likes him or has any repsect for him - this is just more proof of that.
2016-04-19	The Goldman Sachs funded shills in this comment section sure love their employer Cruz.
2016-04-19	That's why he just won the last 5 states Buwahahah reality check aisle 3.
2016-04-19	Bullshit, his own fucking party hates him.
2016-04-19	Wow. When Hannity blows up at you and you're the number one con, game over.
2016-04-19	Peter Krantz get real... Hannity has been on no fence... duh!
2016-04-19	Trump Got It Right Again. This Is the Undeniable Proof...      http://survivemagazine65435.blogspot.com   This is Donald Trump's most shocking statement yet,      However the mainstream media isn't saying a word about it!      What are they really trying to cover up?   I'm sending this to all my friends, family and patriot brothers......See More
2016-04-19	Peter Krantz Rush and Hannity are media opportunists. Playing their koolaid drinking go bots like fiddles. They could care less who wins as long as they get paid.
2016-04-19	Cruz has taken a hit on the polls since all this voterless election nonsense. If Cruz wins the nomination because of this I guarantee you millions of Republicans will be sitting this one out, which doesn't really matter because Cruz and Clinton are owned by the same people.
2016-04-19	It would be hard to be more wrong than what you just posted. i supposed it's theoretically possible like wormholes and stuff.
2016-04-19	Nick Hail, the gop has become a dick measuring party.
2016-04-19	And if Trump steals the nomination with just a plurality of delegates, millions of actual Republicans will sit out the election rather than vote for Stumpy McTrumpfingers. Actual Republicans (unlike you, obviously) want an actual Republican to run under the GOP banner, not a loudmouth Northeastern liberal conman.
2016-04-19	You would never see this type of exchange between Democrats and their allies in the Media... like POLITICO...
2016-04-19	Chris Matthews vs Jeff Weaver
2016-04-19	because the candidate running far behind in second place is not actively trying to steal the election from the candidate in first place...
2016-04-19	Actually you do. If you watched any networks aside from FNC, you'd probably know that.
2016-04-19	Tad Devine: we will win New York   Sanders: We will have a major victory in New York      New York voters: no.
2016-04-19	The biggest lesson learned by Bernie?      Attacking others as unqualified shoiuld be left to others especially when you react directly to an "anonymous" source in an article and don't respond to actual quotes of the person your attacking.      The second lesson learned. If you get schrewed in a newspaper editor interview you develop an answer for that question because you know now that the same question will be asked again and the next time you need to offer a real answer and not more of your stump speech.
2016-04-19	You're candidate has been running for president for at least nine years and almost blew a forty point lead in her home state. She's trying to limp across the finish line, not very inspiring.
2016-04-19	Take a look at the county returns - Upstate voted overwhelmingly for Bernie. What about when the FBI comes out with their findings?
2016-04-19	The math just got way worse. Sanders need an average of 58% of remaining delegates to catch up (not including super deligates). Now that number us well into the 60's maybe as high as 70% of remaining deligates. Pennsylvana, MD, and NJ are out there with similar demographics. That will move the needle een further. Sanders ran a good campaign but now its just sour grapes.

2016-04-19	Amen
2016-04-19	Well, Clinton makes 27m a year so even then he would not be making that much in this campaign.

2016-04-19	Unlike the caucus states filled with white kids, Large state like NY is diverse and people has real problems and demand real solutions.      BS has nothing to offer.      There is only one caucus state left, BS. be honest and do the party a favor and stick to issues instead of character assassination.

She even spearheaded an initiative at the state dept to spread fracking worldwide.WOW! You Democrats actually support her? Wake up A'mericur! Talk about the Republican WET DREAM! but yet she is a democrat...pretty sure she gets the presidency cuz she plays both sides of the aisle like a true shapeshifter.
2016-04-19	Scott Lemon If you didn't notice, democrats are rejecting this kind of campaigning. Your candidate is in the last gasps of a dying campaign. Do it with dignity.
2016-04-19	Sanders began sounding more like trump. Angry, negative, false accusations, grandiose promises without a plan for implementation, and flip flops. That is why he lost my support.
2016-04-19	you gotta be kidding??? Hillary and her campaign respond to all dissent as if she is a victim as well as talking down to other viewpoints as if those viewpoints come from children. That, in fact, is a great revelation as to her true character.
2016-04-19	Scott Lemon B.S. fled to Vermont tonight, gave no congratulatory message to Hillary (she has always congratulated him when he has won), and he evaded all but local press when his plane landed. Meanwhile his surrogate, Jeffe Weaver was making an ass out of himself on TV. No, I am not kidding and apparently New Yorkers didn't like the B.S. negative tone either. Hillary won big and got more votes than all Republican candidates combined.

2016-04-19	Lenny Smith He's just more proof of the racism that's undergirds the American conservative movement like fat in bacon.
2016-04-19	Disgusting Rafael, lying, cheating his way through.....its absolutely awful. This guy should have been disqualified after what he did to Dr. Ben Carson. Shameful! Given his cheating history about time we the people start a "Stop Cruz" movement!
2016-04-19	Oh Please..... shameful that you fall for everything you hear! ......   Todd Starnes      I don't seem to recall the Mainstream Media or the Conservative pundits expressing as much excitement when Cruz won Texas -- as they did when Trump won New York.   And just for a bit of perspective -- for the MSM and the pundits who say Cruz is now doomed....   Cruz got more than 1.2 million votes in his Texas victory. Trump got more than 400,000 votes in his New York victory. (Note: Trump's numbers may go up - votes still being counted.)
2016-04-19	Cruz is trying to get the rules changed so that no one else could be put to a vote. Then, the people dumping Trump would have no one else to vote for. It's Cruz' only hope.
2016-04-19	Not correct. Rule 40 has been in place since 2012 and it bars anyone who has won less than 8 states from being considered for the nomination. Trump and Cruz want it to stay in place while Kasich wants it removed.
2016-04-19	Just like this slimmy elfin to try to wiggle in through the back door. Not for nothing that he won the vote for the most punchable face.
2016-04-19	Delegate hunter sounds so creepy. It sounds like something someone would do in China. Hunt down the dissenters. And they say thatTrump is the one bringing fascism. XD
2016-04-19	Away goes Bernie Sanders crazy delusional old bitter white wannabe Che Guevara to the whitest state in the union Vermont bye bye don't come back
2016-04-19	Don't be so dismissive, Claudia. If half of those who voted for Bernie did not show up on General Election day, Hillary will be 'former presidential candidate' AGAIN. So just be careful when you open your mouth.
2016-04-19	Kevin Smith vice versa
2016-04-19	Jeromi Wiggins Sanders will take 70% of the independents over the few old ladies who will not vote for him because they can't vote for a female presidential candidate. Any day!
2016-04-19	Not really sure the Bernmomentum can take a day off in Penn. The path is not pretty now, losing Penn would make it unsurmountable.

2016-04-19	Aardvark Aardvarks I didn't want to be overly harsh :)
2016-04-19	kit's Hillary all the way from here on in. she'll get Calif in a landslide.
2016-04-19	Please show some class Senator Sanders and stop attacking Hillary Clinton. You only come across as a grumpy, angry sore loser. Please show the world what kind of character you have. Stop creating hate in your supporters against Clinton. The choice is totally yours on how you will be remembered in the history of presidential campaigns.
2016-04-19	I quit supporting him because to the negative campaign he has been running. He started off with a really good tone, but once he started losing he took a wrong turn.
2016-04-19	good thoughts, but I have sussed him several months ago.. he is passive aggressive, petty vindictive, malicious and devious to the core.. he is running on sheer ego and bravado by now..   he really doesn't have much of a platform.. why he focuses on the young.. impressionable,, unformed. idealistic.. he doesn't have a clue.. why he cannot really elaborate on his agenda.. all he has to run on is lambasting Hillary assuming this will make him .. he insults people's intelligence. as he is not too bright.. he is a lightweight.. AND his wife is no better.
2016-04-19	Art Rieber I was really torn at the beginning and made no decision either way. Early into the primary season, a Sanders supporter called me an idiot for being uncommitted. I am not an idiot. I was a policital scientist, office holder and attorney. Make your jokes, but one thing I am not is an old fool. This scenario was repeated several times until, finally, I began seeing patterns in Sanders supporters that concerned me. I want a Democrat in the White House and the Bernie or Bust thing finally did me in.
2016-04-19	Congratulations Hillary Clinton. She has worked hard and she deserves this huge victory.
2016-04-19	hear. hear..
2016-04-19	Yea winning her "home" state is a real big victory... clap clap clap....
2016-04-19	Love Sewing   Hey, Bernie claimed that New York was his home state and they rejected him by 18 points! Feel the burn.
2016-04-19	SO BEFORE THE POLLS CLOSE SANDERS POS BRAGS HOW WELL HE IS GONNA DO IN NEW YORK, WHEN THE POLLS CLOSE SHOWING HE GOT C R U S H E D, WHAT DOES HE DO???? RUNS HOME, AVOIDINING THE MEDIA, RUNS AWAY LIKE A C O W A R D A CRUSHED COWARD, GOODBYE AND GOOD RIDDANCE SANDERS POS
2016-04-19	his ego runneth over.. no reticence. no wisdom.. not ready for Primetime..and at his age.. he never will.. he'll hit t he bucket first.. a crushed old man,   he's doing it to himself..
2016-04-19	Elizabeth Pengson if any post will convince independents to not support Clinton in the general, it is yours....thanks for making it easy....
2016-04-19	Drew Hamilton Thanks for the delightfully different perspective, and I mean that :)
2016-04-19	HRC didn't win in the PNW, but she still won in a lot of diverse places.
2016-04-19	Bernie got 2 more points than Obama in 2008 and that WITHOUT the majority black votes. Does that tell you something? Hillary is NET NEGATIVE candidate.
2016-04-19	Kevin Smith When you have MORE votes than the other guy....you are winning.
2016-04-19	Kevin Smith Democratic Party == very slow learning curve - hates their true base, and think becuase its Trump -- so extreme they will all come running to Mrs. Wall sT. money bags -- they can not figure it out - dumber than a box of rocks
2016-04-19	not according to the results on the maps. more clinton spin and lying .
2016-04-19	And how do facts lie? Have you looked at the exit polls. She won miniority votes by over 60%.
2016-04-19	Stephanie Sommer look at the map results ; please. she is not winning up state. but no one will look and buy the spin and lies. how she rolls . CA fix this wall street and "firewall" wall mess.
2016-04-19	Stephanie Sommer Bernie got 2 more points than Obama in 2008 and that WITHOUT the majority black votes. Does that tell you something? Hillary is NET NEGATIVE candidate.
2016-04-19	She won by a 15 point difference in NY, that's something. Now the next will she will probably make it clear that she will get the nomination before Sanders.
2016-04-19	Bernie got 2 more points than Obama in 2008 and that WITHOUT the majority black votes. Does that tell you something? Hillary is NET NEGATIVE candidate.
2016-04-19	Kevin Smith no, it tells you Bernie did better than Obama. Hillary beat them both in NY. You're spinning.
2016-04-19	Kevin Smith What step is this talking point on your Bernie Delusion Twelve-Step ladder?
2016-04-19	What on earth is she talking about? Look at the NY county level map!   http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/new-york?hp...
2016-04-19	The COUNTRY, not just NY.
2016-04-19	By the same logic, shouldn't you give the GOP the presidency already?      https://upload.wikimedia.org/.../2000px-2012_Presidential...      We don't elect people based on how large the area they won. Sorry it doesn't work that way.   You have to get past denial in order to deal with grief.
2016-04-19	The results on the maps say that with the exception of Albany County, which is crammed with college students, Hillary beat Bernie in every NY County where more than 40,000 people voted. By a lot.

2016-04-19	In response, the super delegates laughed and laughed and laughed.......
2016-04-19	Of course the Bernie Bots won't see the hypocrisy if the Supers steal the primary for Bernie unlike their positions back in February.      Not gonna happen.
2016-04-19	Scott Henricks He wins General election matchups every time. Hillary is a coin toss each matchup. The Super delegates are there for the sole purpose of getting the party in power come november. Thats why the GOP elites are so ready to pick Cruz over trump (even when trump gets the majority) Trump loses to Hillary by a decent amount and he gets DESTROYED by Bernie. Cruz usually wins vs Hillary and narrowly loses to Bernie.   Bernie does WAY better with independants, and its been polled that those same independants wont vote for her come november. Thats why all the matchup polls show Hillary losing to anyone that isnt Trump and Bernie sweeping any republican he is up against.
2016-04-19	Ulrick Aaron VanGan Why this sudden faith in theoretical polling?
2016-04-19	3 words;   Policy, Policy, Policy.   The American voter has spoken loud and clear on what they want to hear, and they want specifics.   Bernie Sanders' only mistake has been not enough specifics and not budging on his talking points.   Bernie's only chance was and is to shake things up with bold policy specifics -      Things like leveling the playing field for small businesses - an across the board internet sales tax, subsidized worker programs, subsidized training programs, long term low interest loans.      Black voters - Exponentially Expand "The Job Corps" and other subsidized worker programs & subsidize...See More
2016-04-19	Calling out the media is too cliche. No one listens. As for policy specifics, that's been Bernie's Achilles heel.
2016-04-19	@Doug Richardson the problem for Sanders is that he makes a lot of promises, but has no answers to how he plans to get anything done.   After everything said and done Sanders was caught with his own words just ask the New York Daily News.
2016-04-19	Philip E Clarkson Jr Quit using that New York Daily News article, New York Times called them out saying that NYDN didn't know what they were talking about and that Bernie was right but Hillary supporters hate facts. Here is the article: http://www.nytimes.com/.../yes-bernie-sanders-knows...
2016-04-19	But I thought superdelegates were Dark Lords of the Evil Establishment bent on thwarting the people's will?      Team Sanders has officially jumped the shark.
2016-04-19	Richard, it's okay if they thwart the voters will, but only if they vote for Saint Bernie of Sanders.
2016-04-19	Perfectly put!
2016-04-19	dont forget that bernie sanders is............wait for it..............a super delegate
2016-04-19	In response the super delegates asked the Sanders campaign what % of minority votes Sanders gets .....then they walk away
2016-04-19	Exactly i have been preaching this for months.
2016-04-19	Jeromi Wiggins      Which is EXACTLY why Hillary lost the super delegates in 2008.      The Sanders campaign is absolutely delusional.
2016-04-19	Bill Roby:      There you go again, calling out the vulgar hypocrisy, unacknowledged white racism, and cretinous sexism of Saint Bernie and his followers.      FACTS, Bill, have no place in Bernie World! See, Saint Bernie of lily white, affluent Vermont and his young, white privileged bros. and their young, privileged "girls" (note the ownership), why, they don't have to answer to charges of their vulgar hypocrisy, unaknowledged white racism, cretinous sexism, et al.

Would I feel the same if the tables were turned and Clinton was planning the same thing? Honestly, I don't know. But having moved to Norway and seeing how countries deal with more than two viable parties, I get a different view of this process than I had before.

2016-04-20	Naturo Free So sad to see you go. It's ok, I will vote for her on your behalf :) See ya!
2016-04-20	Not going to happen. 79% of independets who are Bernie supporters will never vote Hillary - as of poll released last week.      Per DNC poll - talked about yesterday on CNN election coverage, 40% of Dem voters will not vote Hillary.      I remember both the Nixon years and the Clinton years. I will do all that I can to warn people of what is to come if she isn't indicted, prosecuted, and put in prison for the rest of her natural days.      Besides - ask yourself this. Hillary says she is pivoting to the general and is attacking Trump. Trump is the only candidate she has a chance of beating in the ge...See More
2016-04-20	Sander is not only hurt the democratic party, himself but also his legacy
2016-04-20	I disagree He is a FDR "New Deal Democrat" Hillary Clinton is a corporate-owned Republican
2016-04-20	Earl Shumaker Oh really? You mean the wealthiest man in the country FDR? The President in the top 1% who understood the plight of working people? Clinton is FDR, not Sanders. She offers real plans that can actually help people. Sanders offers nothing but words, he won't even help congressional canididates get funded yet he would need them to get anything passed. Go look at Clinton's record at ontheissues dot org before you spout off nonsense about her being a Republican, she voted the same as Bernie 93% of the time, she was ranked the #11 most liberal Senator (Obama #17, Biden #23). Clinton is a real Democrat who will make real changes she's spent a lifetime putting together her thoughtful policies, Sanders is a one trick pony with no real solutions.
2016-04-20	Hope Royaltey   Agree...
2016-04-20	A big win by HRC, but already we see Bernie supporters alleging fraud. And Weaver says they will still try to convince the Super delegates to go against the will of the voters. Wondering what their end game really is? Just want the money for another few months? the adoring crowds? the anger? Will be interesting to see what happens.
2016-04-20	The "end game" is a political party that's not just a corporate puppet. That's not a war we give up on, even if we lose a thousand battles.
2016-04-20	Sherry Weaver is a fool.Super delegates will stay with Clinton.they want to win in Nov.its over for Sanders.
2016-04-20	Alex McConnell Well said
2016-04-20	man its like a ghost town in the comments section. where all my loyal bernie bros at? its kinda lonely with no one calling me a shill or a sell out or a paid troller
2016-04-20	Shill
2016-04-20	How about calling you a racist and a sexist for using a term for Bernie supporters that is super derogatory towards minority supporters?
2016-04-20	Alex McConnell the term bernie bros is saved for the special supporters who use inflammatory remarks and nasty language towards hrc and her supporters. i am tired of being called brain washed or stupid or uniformed while the candidate i support is called a whore, a shill, a war monger. i am past being civil with these pieces of filth. if you find yourself in this category then please feel free to assume i have called you a bernie bros. if you dont fall into this category, dont get your panties/boxers in a bunch
2016-04-20	Actually, I think Sanders' supporters may be in for a very pleasant surprise. Clinton may do more to carry forward their policies than they think. Untethered from the campaign and all the rubish that is spoken about her, I think we will see a different Hillary than we might have expected.
2016-04-20	Why would you expect to see a different Hillary? That's just beyond stupid~
2016-04-20	"Different" ??! How? Start telling the truth for once?
2016-04-20	"Pleasant" is FAR from how I would describe anything to do with Lady Cankles.

2016-04-20	Why are people making such a big deal of the "closed" primary in NY?? It's that way in MOST states. The Democratic Party has the right to say that only registered Democrats vote in their primary. Same for the GOP. Independent and non-partisan voters get to vote in November. If they want to form their OWN party and nominate a candidate, they're free to do so. Like the Green Party for example. They nominated Ralph Nader a few times. And we all know how well that turned out in 2000 when their votes cost Al Gore the Presidency and Bush got elected. But hey, elections have consequences, right?? Be careful what you wish for, I've heard say.
2016-04-20	Because it's bad for bernie. That open primaries are bad for Clinton, well that's totally fair.... OF COURSE!   BERNIE SLANDERS is now running on the idea that since he has LOST the popular vote, it's still ONLY HIM THAT represents the will of the people ... go figure that.
2016-04-20	Sigeline Zacharias nice of a fake facebook profile filled of stock photos to defend hillary
2016-04-20	Joao Fonseca They have them all over - fake people like the copororations they represent. Looking at the NY geography -- you have to travel pretty far and wide to get to a county that didn't vote Bernie http://www.theguardian.com/.../new-york-primary-live...
2016-04-20	It turns out Sanders mostly won the rural counties of upstate and western ny. Clinton did win in Syracuse, Rochester and yes Buffalo the writer of this article got it wrong. Late votes in Buffalo pushed Clinton over the top there.   As for the voting problem in Brooklyn and Sanders crying foul, do you know what I find funny about this it's that Clinton was winning in Brooklyn by a lot. It really sounds like a lot of those voters could be her's not his considering how the voting was going in those area's.
2016-04-20	56% of NY GOP voters definitely voting for Trump should he win the nomination?   Fortunately that's the 56% that doesn't matter.

2016-04-20	New Yorkers fell right in line. Very predictable.
2016-04-20	Do the eat fish like a seal? actually -- they didn't look at the map -- so sorry HRC -- you lost http://www.theguardian.com/.../new-york-primary-live... Hillary -- you lost all of upstate NY except for the inner cities. If Independents would have voted he would have won all of them -- you are soo stupid you will lose to Trump
2016-04-20	Roger R. Hill If you look at those upstate votes, Bernie's wins were counted in the 100s while in NYC, Hillary beat Bernie by 10s of thousands. Quite lame to proclaim that in counties with not many dems, Bernie won considering Hillary beat him by almosst 300k votes total. Hillary also got double the votes Trump did. So you calling someone else stupid doesn't really mean very much.
2016-04-20	http://www.theguardian.com/.../new-york-primary-live... Hillary -- you lost all of upstate NY except for the inner cities. If Independents would have voted he (Bernie) would have won all of them -- you are soo stupid you will lose to Trump. God damn it press -- "Do you effing job"
2016-04-20	Anyone would know that in the general election Sanders beats everyone with Independents -- Hillary not so much -- Hillary lost with her whoring for Wall St. money to get her riches and claim she feel your pain to poor black people - amazing low informational voters. Her wars, Libya, No fly zone in Syria, Iraq nea-con vote, her slow at the switch for indenifying climate change being for TPP and Keystone all point to a big switcheroo and Bernie people see it coming!!!!!!      Until Bernie (the tried and true and documented real deal got her to say "me too" Well only a spoonfed Fox newser idiot would miss these obvious signals that she ain't no progressive. Shes a say anything for now - Republican lite Wall streeter who pays lip service aims low, and says it her turn in a party that is way to her left. Why I'm even discussing this with a fascist repunant snarky Trump/Cruz un-intellgencia is special anyway and WTF would you know about it?
2016-04-20	Roger R. Hill Short bus Cliinton and Sanders voted the same 93% of the time. Spare us all the holier than though talk. Your guys record after 25 years in congress is getting 3 bills passed. 2 bills to rename post offices and one bill to fix the Vets cost of living adjustment. With record of "achievement" you think that "real seal" was going to reinvent the wheel.      You're really clueless to how our system works.
2016-04-20	Roger R. Hill Anyone would know that Bernie is a novice against whom no one has run one truly negative ad....because they don't take him seriously enough to try to define him.

2016-04-20	I cannot stand Paul Ryan and his budget cutting hurt as many people as he can ideas. Please proceed, GOP. HIllary will wipe the stage with whomever you decide to run.
2016-04-20	I can't wait for Sanders to do away with the federal budget, just start handing out whatever any department wants, it will be great.
2016-04-20	What is the reason for budget cutting? Overspending... Why has it become so bad to not spend money YOU DONT HAVE? I gradduated with a degree in economics. I know the importance of Keynesian economics and deficit spending. But I also know a simple fact. We arent made money and cant pay for everything. Ignoring cuts now just causes the government to be forced to cut bigger and important programs in the future. Soon we wont be able to pay for SS. Currently I am paying taxes for SS that I will never recieve. Its because of the inability for politicians to make cuts and a balenced budget why the retirement dream will be dead to me when I am that age.      And before someones says "Print more money" just stop. Printing signifiantly more than average inflation causes irreversable damage to the American Economy as it destroys American buying power. For country that hardly makes products anymore, that is disastorous
2016-04-20	If Clinton wins the democatic race, Ryan will dive in      Cause Ryan and everyone else knows, he can beat Hillary      If Bernie wins, Ryan will stay out, knowing Bernie would mop the floor with he   and any other Republican in November ...

2016-04-20	I'm just shocked the Cruzifix, whom now even Satan has disavowed, didn't offer a victory speech last night after getting trounced, coming in third and leaving NY without a single delegate. It's what he does..."God Bless the great state of New York!"
2016-04-20	Donald Trump is absolutely the most absurdly juvenile presidential candidate we have ever seen. Short on policy but long on personal insults.
2016-04-20	Break down anything Cruz says and it's still a string of insults and slanted remarks -- it's just that he sounds so much like Glenn Beck, Limbaugh, and Hannity, that we don't notice. But his policies scare me more and I wish someone would wake up the republican voters to what he's saying. "Eliminate the payroll tax" means that the social security fund which is still solvent would immediately lose HALF its funding for benefits. One-third of Americans rely on their social security as their only retirement income when they retire. #2 - Eliminate corporate income taxes. So evidently, only the peons will pay taxes. (Though 2/3 of corporations don't pay a thing -- he wants to be equal opportunity).      Cruz's ideas are crazy -- but thought out -- I fear his ideas more because if Republicans have proven anything is that they are terrible accountants.
2016-04-20	Hannity fully supports Donald Trump. Limbaugh is riding the fence so who knows where he stands. The difference between Cruz and Trump is that Cruz speaks like an adult and can actually answer a policy question whether you agree with his answer or not. Trump talks like a fifth grader who is whining about the process and calling people names. He stomps his feet and cries like a baby when he doesn't get his way. Now his thugs are threatening delegates who may not vote their way. Classy.
2016-04-20	Robert Borden That's funny, Cruz can't even answer a softball question from Hannity. Sean asked him 4 times yesterday, "explain how the process works regarding getting unbound delegates to come to your side" the MF'r could not and would not answer, just kept repeating his same lame-ass comments about Trump. Cruz is the absolute worst of the worst.
2016-04-20	Listen ted cruz is not eligible to be prez or VP. He is not natural born as required by constitution. He became a naturalized US citizen when he was 16. He was born in Canada of cuban father. Despite what any corrupted judge in funny robes says he does not qualify for the presidency.I do not need any judge to confuse the obvious. If anybody does not want to run by the rules of the constitution they can leave the country
2016-04-20	Every obama appointee, especailly the muslims and muslim sympathizers in the adminstration, needs to be purged the day obama leaves. Were I the new president, I would have all their resignations on my desk that first day I was in office. Brennen, Carter, Lynch. All of them
2016-04-20	another bad idea from a tea bagger.. so are you saying Yellen is Muslim or a Muslim Sympathizer?? how would you know?? Only Christians do good things???

2016-04-20	Lou Kaye Palin will be the next defense secretary and your MUSLIM Brotherhood comrades are going to get a serious spanking :-)
2016-04-20	What people want to raise the interest rate? The only ones saying that seem to me named Trump. The time I checked in the news Yellen was happy with where are interest rates stood. BTW Trump our economy is not crippled. Yes it's up and moving not towards a recession. Compared to most of the world the US is doing great.   Hey Trump at least the US government does not go bankrupt and screw it's shareholders like you have done 4 times.
2016-04-20	And let's not forget that Daffy Drumpf, that man of the people, has a tax plan that gives himself a huge break and basically bankrupts (where have we seen that word before?) the country. That it's up to the "little people" to make up the shortfall in government revenues.
2016-04-20	Lew Fournier you and the rest of the "little people" on the left pay no federal income tax, you're bloodsucking vermin. Trump will force you to engage in personal responsibility for the first time in your freeloading lives, it's going to be marvelous to watch :-)

2016-04-20	Neal Levine Yeah I know! I just found it funny that Cruz gets trounced and it seems hot messes did the job.. though they are both fools
2016-04-20	the real contest isn't for nomination   it's for who's a bigger piece of crap: Trump or Cruz   my money's on cruz, but only on a 5:3 bet
2016-04-20	I think we all can acknowledge that Ted Cruzifix knows a hot mess when he sees one.   That pretty much defines his whole political career. Now if he would just takes that mess back to Texas where they don't seem to notice the smell.
2016-04-20	Better yet, take it back to Canada, his home. Maybe tex-ass will secede and become part of Canada? I doubt they'd want it.
2016-04-20	Cruz is well organized and 300 delegates behind. Who cares if his people were strictly potty trained?
2016-04-20	One thing that needs to be made clear is a loss is only a resounding loss if there is an expectation of winning. Cruz never thought for a moment he had any chance of winning last night. More important, he realized early on, the national media, especially Fox News is totally in the tank for Trump. Trump has gotten more than 2 billiion in free media since he announced and yet Cruz keeps getting closer and closer to him. One last point, there is actually a center of th universe, but all of us in the other states of US would like topoint out to those in the NY metro area, you are not it....

2016-04-20	Ian you repeat the same thing everyday.
2016-04-20	Funny with all that money raised and everyone hating everone within the GOP they might as well piss that money good bye
2016-04-20	Really Neal...there must be an awful lot of rich haters huh. What you always write: You can't fix stupid....baahaaaaa
2016-04-20	They're going to need a lot of turd-polishing money to stand any kind of chance in a nation-wide race. They're going to need several billion more, I would guess.
2016-04-20	Yup...two mid terms and over a thousand seats lost to cons...keep up the brilliance sport.
2016-04-20	Money they have to pour into CONGRESSIONAL races as they know neither Trump or Cruz can win a General Election but could cost them Congress if Clinton is elected by too large a margin.
2016-04-20	trump will win , and he might just pardon hillary .
2016-04-20	"'Now all he can do is be a spoiler'      That pretty much defines Ted Cruzifix's entire political career, doesn't it.   Never constructive, always destructive.   If Texas does secede from the Union, if they take the would-be Elmer Gantry with them, I vote Aye.
2016-04-20	Clearly you know absolutely nothing about either Ted Cruz or Texas. But, in keeping with Trumpbot behavior, that doesn't stop you from spouting idiocy.
2016-04-20	Absolutely to both! Where do I sign! ?
2016-04-20	Don't you mean Canada?
2016-04-20	So according to this article, Ted Cruz has been mathematically eliminaTED by New York, and he will be mathematically eliminated again next week. So we get to celebrate twice. Nice!
2016-04-20	Keep dreaming. You do realize that of the 71 delegates in Pennsylvaina, 54 are unbound and many have already pledged their support for Cruz. Right now, Cruz has pledged support from 170 unbound delegates. The number of 559 is the bound delgates he has at the present time. Add 170 to 559, and Cruz has 729. TRump has a total of 2 unbound delegates. You like Trump and so many of his supporters do not have a clue how the system works or what the actual numbers are right now. Trump is just trying to hide the fact that he screwed up and did not pay attention to how the process works, is gettin ghis butt kicked and unless he gets a miracle, has no chance of being the nominee. The number of party supporters for Cruz vs Trump is 9 to 1, just to add insult to injury.

2016-04-20	For someone who has lost every race since Arizona and for the past two weeks has been constantly whining about the process being unfair, he sure is being arrogant. The process he keeps complaining about has beeb a benefit to him more than any other candidate. LAst hight he won 60% of the vote but got 95% of the delegates. In florida, 42% of vote, 100% of delegates, Arizona - 38% of vote - 100% of delegates, South Carolina 32% of vote - 100% of delegates. No Cruz cannot win outright before the convention and it is very unlikely Trump can either. Trump is starting this narrative because he knows he will not win on the first ballot at a contested convention and the organization Cruz has makes it very likely he would win on a second or third ballot.
2016-04-20	Leading to a record loss for the GOP in the general election. Cruz most unpopular Senator in the Senate among his peers. Some candidate if he is indeed eligible to run, gotta see what the birthers do with a court challange if he is the nominee
2016-04-20	John Fellows ...and as the most unpopular Senator (as you say), he still beats Hillary in the general in most polls while Trump loses in virtually all polls. With Trump, Red states become purple, Like Texas and Utah. Cruz has a decent chance to turn blue states like Wisconsin Red. If Trump thinks he can trun New York Red, he's sadly mistaken - Hillary got more than twice his vote total in New Yawk and even bernie beat him by 200K votes. It is literally the sewer of America, and supported the lead Sewer Rat, Donald Trump to try to mess up the GOP more. Trump is about the only person in America who loses to Hillary, the most unlikable candidate since Richard Nixon.
2016-04-20	John Samborski what polls have you been reading? The data just does not back up what you say
2016-04-20	A Spoiler can turn "Donnie 2 Times" to a huge loser, One man's spoiler is another man's   champion..
2016-04-20	Trump needs 1237 to win the first ballot. Very difficult road for him. Seems he is set up to be a spoiler too. Or why can he just not be a man and run his campaign? He crys and whines like a child The rules are set by the GOP. They have not changed. Time for Trump to put some big boy undies on and act like a man.
2016-04-20	So Pigboy Limbaugh, Mark Levin and Glenn Beck are the Cruzifix's reference points.      Can't imagine why he would get crushed worse than Goldwater in a general election. He's so open to people who don't think the way he does.   Isn't it time to try and shut something down, Teddy?
2016-04-20	TBH I wouldn't vote for either Ted or Little Donni, but Cruz isn't wrong, especially the regarding Hannity. The sheer volume of bootlicking and pro Trump puff pieces he engages in is breathtaking.
2016-04-20	Wilford Rios Carvajal There are 92 million people that are unemployed in the U.S. and when they fall off the unemployment payment record, they are no longer counted. Americans have lost $2,000 in their yearly income, more people are on food stamps and welfare than ever before. The President doesnt have a thing to do with the low gas prices, it is Saudi Arabia trying to run the U.S. frackers and small oil businesses out of business. health Insurance is only cheaper if you are poor and getting a subsidy, otherwise, it is almost unaffordable for the rest. How do you know that the 1 per cent is getting taxed more? what is your source? You know that the defiit is based on what your budget is and if you stay on track. Our budget is sky high. As to job growth, according to the Gov. report illegals and immigrants have taken 100 per cent of the job growth.
2016-04-20	Wilford Rios Carvajal You are delusionalI Record unemployment along with record low participation rates. Cheaper gas despite Obama's EPA regulations to choke out the oil drilling.. Cheaper health insurances rates yet the insurers are pulling out of the exchanges because the financials do not add up..      I wonder what planet you liberals live on to be so out of touch.
2016-04-20	Trump has received an estimated $1.9 billion in free airtime from television outlets (most of it from the Trump super PAC formerly known as Fox News Channel). Oh, an Hannity is an idiot.
2016-04-20	Ted's fangs are starting to show. Make sure you wear garlic around your neck and have a cross under your pillow when you go to sleep tonight, Sean.
2016-04-20	There is no more apt name for that weirdo than Fat Dracula.   I'd bet my house he smells like Doritos + sour milk
2016-04-20	Cruz spanked Sean like the Trump fanboy he is.
2016-04-20	But cruz got spanked in tennessee
2016-04-20	Jeromi Wiggins So? We are typically a RINO state so it didn't surprise me. I don't jump on stupid band wagons.
2016-04-20	Cruz keeps telling Trump to stop whining yet Cruz is always whining about "boo hoo Trump gets all of the attention....everybody loves Raymond, Raymond Raymond Raymond"...sound familiar...
2016-04-20	Since Sean's usual interview style is to ask the candidate how they got to be so awesome and how they handle the evil democrats, Ted had to do a whole lot of evading to piss him off. I'm no fan of Trump but Sean is right. The process is confusing for most people. You vote, you think it matters but it doesn't. Ted refusing to address this by saying that people don't care about the process is ridiculous. He wants the party insiders to hand him the nomination regardless of the will of the voters. The fact that they can do that is extremely unsettling to most people.
2016-04-20	I dont know because I dont watch Hannity, but an article said that Sean asked Cruz this same question Friday night. Cruz didnt set this process up so why dont Hannity find out for himself? Sean doesnt seem interested that Trump has more delegates than his votes allow. He doesnt seem interested that Trump previously has not gotten over about 40 per cent of the vote in any state but he got 100 per cent of the delegates in some states. Can Trump explain that process? In Missouri Cruz was only 2000 votes behind Trump and I believe Trump got them all, so is that fair? Why continue to hammer Cruz for a system that has been in place for years and will not be changed this year, but this is the criteria he has to run by?
2016-04-20	Since when is it Senator Cruz's job to explain the delegate process, Sarah Harper??!! He didn't make the rules, the processhas been in place for a long time and other candidates past have navigated it just fine. Hannity, as a talk show host should do his own homework and educate his viewship on the process! There is such a thing as 'google' as well! If someone is confused, they can educate themselves....what a novel idea!!! Each state has their own set up...only the individual states and their citizens can change it...it is called 'state's rights'!! Senator Cruz wants to talk about the imp...See More
2016-04-20	Linda League because trump win by peoples votes but your candidate get delegates without peoples votes.. How you like that idea? Because he knows he is not going to win and will never win, he is paid just to stop Trump to get the magic number. Agree or not embrace the reality.

(links to docs embedded)   and so...hil-liar-y did lie to the American people and especially to those four families who lost their loved ones...and she lied about her lies      what kind of American are you that you can support a proven congenital liar?...what is it like to meet and converse and interact with such a person?...would you trust them with your children?...to "house-sit" for you?
2016-04-20	give it a rest Mark. She may have told 20 stories and do you know why? Because, as the Republican led House Committee report said " the information coming in for days, weeks, and even months was contradictory and conflicting. "      What part of that do you nuts not get? HRC and the administration were not sitting in Benghazi. All kinds of information was coming in....some of it was 100 percent wrong, some of it was partly right and it was utter chaos. Only the loons think that the information was all known the night of the atack, so that everything she said that night proved she was a liar. Have ANY of you loons read a single one of the investigative reports? Or do you just think the R's are covering for HRC?
2016-04-20	Why don't you crawl back up Karl Rove's butt so you can feel safe and warm, Mark?
2016-04-20	Um, is there a candidate in this election who hasn't told a long list of whoppers? Practically everything Bernie Sanders says is a lie (he voted for the Clinton crime bill he's been crucifying Hillary over). Cruz and Trump don't even know a lie as it crosses their lips. You're going to have to find a far different standard than honesty, or not vote.
2016-04-20	Keep talking, Hilary team. Sanders is going to contest in every state till the end. Wait and watch as the months go by how the national poll numbers change and see how Hillary keeps getting less and less electable.
2016-04-20	Tony Child You sound like a fraud . Just like your candidate. How cute..
2016-04-20	Wait until they stop talking ans run a killer ad instead. You are simply toast. But do keep up the wishful thinking. And keep sending $27 so you can lament the money you wasted as well as being depressed at the outcome. Welcome to the world of grown-ups.
2016-04-20	Tony Child you sound like a child
2016-04-20	If you exclude the promised votes and only count the pledged delegates... she has 54% of the current votes and needs at least 43% of the remaining to keep her lead. So, while it is unlikely that Bernie will take more than 57% of remaining delegates it's far from impossible.
2016-04-20	Your numbers are a mess. Clinton needs to win 65% of outstanding deligates to reach 2,027. Sanders needs to win 84% of outstanding deligates to reach 2,027. With each vote the number Sander's needs get harder and harder and the pool of deligates smaller and smaller.
2016-04-20	Howard Fites - An average 7th grader could grasp this simple fact with 5 minutes of study, but not the average Berniebot. Go figure. :-/
2016-04-20	Howard Fites Your numbers are off too. To get to 50%+1, either would need 2026 (there are 4051 pledged delegates).      RCP has Hillary at 1428 this morning and Bernie at 1151. Bernie is going to get more delegates out of WA so lets say he's at 1191 for purposes of who needs what to get to 2026. There are 1400 delegates remaining. Remaining delegates that.....      Hillary needs 2026 - 1428 = 598 / 1400 = 42.7%   Bernie needs 2026 - 1191 = 835 / 1400 = 59.6%      Now these should add up to 100% but they don't because there are still other delegates that haven't been awarded in prior contests. For example, there are still several delegates from last night that haven't been awarded and so forth.      http://www.realclearpolitics.com/.../democratic_delegate...
2016-04-20	very informative website!!!!...made by a self-avowed socialist...it's not big, but it's the video that plays in the background that just goes on&on detailing hillary's lies and flip-flops over many years...if you watch just a little of it and can still vote for hillary...you have no integrity and less than no self respect..   to the maker, i say: very good job      Under no circumstances will I vote for Hillary Clinton.

2016-04-20	They dont need to stop, but if the results in next weeks primaries are near what the polls are currently saying then it will be a time to take a deep look at what he wants to do with his campaign. Even if these polls are reflected in the actual results technically he could still win the majority of the pledged delegates, but it would require making her non viable in almost every remaining state with more then 70 delegates.      So if these polls reflect results he can decide what his goal is with the rest of the campaign. He could go scortched earth and aim to hobble clinton as much as possible, think about a third party run, or aim to still run but mostly in a way of setting more of the policy tone at the convention and start trying to work to bring what part of his supporters he can into unity with the Hillary camp.
2016-04-20	Charles Marsh can anyone go third party at this point? Isn't it too late to get their name on the ballot as a third party candidate in most states?
2016-04-20	Clinton also lead in pledged delegates after the 08 primary against Obama. I guess Obama had no chance that year?      Obama lost to Clinton by larger amounts than Sanders did.      Why should he stop?-

The horrible use of guns to commit horrific acts of agression against innocent school children, by children, has much more deep seated roots. Let's start with making it legal for cowardly medical professionals (for profit) to horrificly kill the most defenseless creature on the earth, an unborn child.

2016-04-20	Yep! Cruz couldn't make it to 20% in N.Y.
2016-04-20	I know. What kind of a rigged system gives a 60% winner 94% of the delegates??? Cruz should have gotten 13 delegates to be "fair". My comments are sarcastic...I actually know the answer.
2016-04-20	Yeah Trump got around 25% of the vote in Texas as I recall and there were a lot more candidates. Anyway Taliban boy can just keep saying so what all the way through the north east and hopefully thereafter.
2016-04-20	Rafael Eduardo de la Cruz is an agent of the communist party of Cuba and its leaders, the Brothers Castro.      He was sent to the US to destroy the Republican party
2016-04-20	As U.S. Senator, Hillary authored a grand total of (3) bills:   One renamed a US Post Office.   One renamed a segment of freeway.   One designated an old brick house as an historic site.   That's it.      Impressive...phenomenal...indeed.
2016-04-20	Ben Fistener...did you get that ditty from Breitbart? Because you're wrong. Hillary Clinton sponsored or co-sponsored 713 bill during her tenure.      SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTEEN.      https://www.congress.gov/member/hillary-clinton/C001041...      And if you were capable of more than cut and paste, you'd know that it was Republicans who controlled congress during the 2000s and thus had control over the agenda.      Next time, do your homework so you won't embarrass yourself in public.
2016-04-20	Wow, Ben. You were just really, really embarrassed by Cheryl.
2016-04-20	Damn Fistener, you've been fisted.
2016-04-20	She did get the first US Ambassador murdered on the job since Cyrus R. Vance was Secretary of State under Carter....AND, she stole Vance's book title, too!
2016-04-20	Ben, you voted twice for a idiot that got 3,000 Americans killed in New York City, and another 5,000 killed looking for WMD's in Iraq...      But who's counting...

2016-04-20	Bob Smith So ben voted for Bill Clinton, interesting.
2016-04-20	For once I agree with The Moocher, it was "phenomenal" of her to "stay married" to a life long woman abuser while the coward press actually pretended they were still married. And she managed to call the Benghazi family member liars as well.      Classy lady indeed Mooch..
2016-04-20	Mike Austin were you aware that several Benghazi family members said they were NOT misled by Hillary after the attack? So who do we believe here? The ones who quietly go about their lives or the ones (the very few ones) who go on Fox and shout that they were lied to? Hmmmm.....who has the agenda here......?
2016-04-20	Mike Austin - your boy Trump was accussed in a court document of rape. Republican Family Values I guess.... I supposed it was a legitimate rape because Ivanka did not get preggers...

2016-04-20	In Cuba, perhaps.
2016-04-20	and if uber-fascist Cruz wins, they can call it Opus Dei, and they can reinstate the inquisition
2016-04-20	Cruz isn't Catholic.
2016-04-20	Daniel Warren Curtis Neither was the Zodiac Killer. Interesting.
2016-04-20	Daniel Warren Curtis he may not be catholic, but his instincts are certainly church rule over state
2016-04-20	Perhaps Senator Cruz should run on the Tea Party ticket since the Republicans certainly don't want him.
2016-04-20	Please!
2016-04-20	Republicans don't seem to be uniting around anyone. I don't see how the GOP gets out of this without losing at least 1/3rd of its voters no matter who is nominated. Cruz is probably the most likely to be able to unite the establishment and non-establishment wings of the party. Trump would be a disaster for the republicans.
2016-04-20	Daniel Warren Curtis Don't want a person that flip flops on Illegal immigration. And just last year gave up their citinship to another nation.
2016-04-20	Take your pick, bullet to the head or poison.
2016-04-20	Or four years of torture if Cruz gets the nod.
2016-04-20	Trump can rename it's party to the Musolinista party, and Cruz can rename its party to Hitlerista.
2016-04-20	Try again.
2016-04-20	It is true that Trump spells doom for Republicans in November, but talk of Cruz being some kind of savior is delusional. There is utterly no evidence that Cruz could attract even conservative Democrats. It's just laughable on the face of it. What these folks cannot grasp is that the Republican Party has painted itself into a social and demographic corner that spells minority status. Sure, voter intimidation and gerrymandering has helped stem the tide, but this is going to be one of those wave years that swamps the little dams the Party has built. If Cruz was wise - which he isn't - he would plan not to contest the nomination further. There is nothing at the end of this road.
2016-04-20	Which would have meant the best chance the GOP had was Kasich, the last month or two. Yet the GOP doesn't want to give a pesky moderate a chance. Heaven forbid, someone who'd resonate with the entire voting pool. Oh well. Live and learn in November.
2016-04-20	George Kovka Jr. Kasic cannot winn any primaries but Ohio and has basically the same poilices as Hildebeast. Cruz will never get the moderate vote since he is basically a Christian jihadist. Trump could possibly attract more Democrat votes. The basic problem for Trump is the elites don'y want him since they have no hold over him. Same as Reagan who was loathed by the same elites.
2016-04-20	George Kovka Jr. If you really look at a lot of Trump positiona, he quite the right center candidate.
2016-04-20	I guess the message discipline had a very short shelf life.

2016-04-20	I would like a Rubio/Ryan ticket as well, but the Trumpkins would throw a fit. I think the GOP's chances of uniting around anyone are becoming increasingly slim. Unlike Rubio, I would not be able to support Trump if he were the nominee.
2016-04-20	Really? Florida is calling out Rubio for not doing his Senatorial job, and Ryan has done nothing positive as Speake, or as a Hosue member. But please proceed. The GOP is poised to jump off a cliff regardless.
2016-04-20	Rick Honaker Rubio is not an establishment candidate. Don't forget he ran against the establishment approve candidates in both his senate race and the presidential campaign.
2016-04-20	Are you kidding me! "The Thirsty One" would need the ice bucket challenge to stay hydrated against Hillary or Bernie in a debate.
2016-04-20	Marco who? Who cares what Rubio thinks about the election. He's suspended. To paraphrase an actual candidate, at this point, what difference does it make?
2016-04-20	Apparently, you do because you clicked the link, likely read the article, and then took the time to comment on it. Moron.
2016-04-20	the system is rigged and it is crooked and Trump is shining a light on this chicanery
2016-04-20	Trump's charge shouldn't be taken seriously, he carping like he does with everything, he wants to be the whinner-in-chief. If things don't go the way he wants its a conspiracy since as he said he's got a brilliant mind and he's a winner. This is a guy that didn't do his homework before he ran is intellectually lazy and doesn't just admit it. Instead he's gotten by with this conspiracy theory for his shortcommings. Grow up and stop being a whimp..
2016-04-20	Sanders is just a prelude to the inevitable coronation of Hillary. The electoral process is a joke
2016-04-20	She wasn't laughing in 2008.
2016-04-20	No joke - she won, he lost, boo hoo, that's how it ALWAYS goes - somebody wins, someone loses, some losers cry, most are grown up and get over it.   McGovern was the anti-establishment, youth candidate in '72; he WON the Dem nomination (then was demolished in the general). So - leftists DO win nominations sometimes - but they usually get whopped in the general election.
2016-04-20	Bri Kau Correct - even though she ran MUCH closer to Obama than Sanders is to her, by hundreds of delegates, and the actual human votes. Bernie raises his $27's, but isn't too good with getting voters. You see, that's how you win elections.
2016-04-20	Trump loves adding derogatory prefixes to his opponent's names... can we all start referring to him as "Tiny Hands Donald"?
2016-04-20	Swing and a miss. Applaud the effort though
2016-04-20	More like "Devil Donald".
2016-04-20	Ben Dovere Trump was born on third base and if he had invested in the stock market, he'd have more money. Then there's 4 bankruptcies where he left others on the hook for billions while he walked away.

2016-04-20	And then you woke up.
2016-04-20	Bernie didn't have a problem when he won Oklahoma - one of the most conservative places in the USA. He only has a problem with the other conservative places where he lost, that's interesting because Oklahoma is very white and the others have lots of black voters.      So maybe Bernie has a problem with black people.
2016-04-20	No, Bernie doesn't have a problem with black people. He's giving an explanation (e.g. a spin) on why he lost the South. The way he said it is unfortunate, but I don't think there's any particular animus against African Americans. He probably didn't even realize that in minimizing his losses, he might have offended some Democratic leaders in the South.
2016-04-20	李淼然 Sanders has been saying things like this consistently for a couple months now. We're way beyond the point of excusing it by saying he just doesn't realize the implications, hence the need for this missive.   I agree it's unlikely he's actively hostile towards black people, but I would characterize him as dismissive of anyone he feels doesn't support him with the fervor he's come to expect, and that seems to include the majority of black people. This is a man who doesn't like to be questioned on anything. As in, if you're not voting for him, it's not because he's done anything wrong, the flaw must be with the voter. It's very concerning to me.
2016-04-20	李淼然   He says a lot of "unfortunate" things Like calling Gun Violence an Urban Youth issue...
2016-04-20	It is sure ironic that the most "progressive" candidate relies on white male votes.

2016-04-20	#hillarybros
2016-04-20	While I agree with the message, I don't see the point of making it this public, especially at this point where it's likely to be seen as piling on (as it turns out by mostly Clinton supporters) now that the point is practically moot, likely to get Sanders' hackles up, and to accentuate the divide between two Democratic constituencies.      Sanders "writing off' the south was obviously just excusing his performance in those states and no one seriously took it as any kind of statement of direction for either Sanders or the Democratic Party.
2016-04-20	Maybe you didn't, but some did.
2016-04-20	Bernie is DEMANDING that Southern Delegates and Southern Votes in Primaries are only counted as 3/5ths of a vote... He said it's in the Constitution!      Besides Bernie wins strong Democratic States like Nebraska, Wyoming, Alaska....
2016-04-20	Obviously people did take as a statement. It most certainly was, by the way. But of course you dismiss those who felt the slight because he is St Bernie.      Again the problem is obviously the listener, not the messenger. Kind of happens a lot these days.
2016-04-20	Hear, hear...but then, a good look at Bernie's political career reveals that he's always been in it for himself, and anyone who doesn't cooperate or agree with him is treated with disdain while he assumes a cynical posture of sanctimonious indignance, with an underlying antagonism that is not hard to see. It's the pattern you've seen over and over in this campaign and he finally began to reveal who he really is in the last 2 weeks. An asshole...just ask his colleagues in the Senate. Sorry, folks, but it's the simple truth.
2016-04-20	The question now is: does he show some class and call it quits, or pull a Nader.
2016-04-20	Joshua Kit Campaign guru Jeff Weaver said yesterday that they would go all the way to the convention and try to flip (read "steal") Hillary's superdelegates. Not a hopeful sign.

2016-04-20	Yes he is surging in the polls. He is in 4th place with delegates in a 3 person race just behind Marco Rubio who dropped out of the race months ago. Funny, Governor Kasich sees something in himself that no one has seen yet. But he is surging in the polls so he says.
2016-04-20	His "surge" is in national polls that include the states that have already voted. It's called buyers remorse or "uh oh, what have I done".
2016-04-20	Truth be known, Ohio would have gone to trump except there was some vote fraud there for Lazy John, being he is the sitting gov.
2016-04-20	Wrong again, Ted. As a retired letter carrier, I can assure you that, if Kasich wanted a career taking his marching orders from nitwits, he'd have been a mailman like his Dad.

2016-04-20	If the GOP was smart they would nominate Kaisch, against Hillary, but they clearly are NOT smart.
2016-04-20	Lyin Ted - you finished last in NY - 0 delegates. Perhaps you should do us all a favor and drop out?
2016-04-20	If someone asked if you'd rather be Trump's veepmate or eat broken glass, you'd have to think on it. Being Number Two to Trump would be like being, well, Number Two.

I don't get your sudden will to shine some new, presidential light on Trump, in effect legitimizing his candidacy. He is a joke of a candidate and always will be.

2016-04-20	yep
2016-04-20	This is the dumbest attack, which is why I'm happy that it's so successful.
2016-04-20	The Democratic Party should welcome him and his progressive message, not continue to dismiss it as too ambitious.
2016-04-20	So we should pretend that his poilcies have a chance of getting through the same repubilcan Congress that has been stonewalling a much more moderate POTUS and his proposals for the last 7+ years? Revolutionary slogans are great for firing up rally crowds, but they don't change the political reality the next dem POTUS will have to face.
2016-04-20	The democratic party has had this same message long before Bernie came around. They just have a better plan to do it....let me rephrase...they actually have a plan to do it.
2016-04-20	Under The Covers You are mistaken. The Democratic party stopped being progressive on economic issues 30 years ago. They had filibuster proof senate, house, and wh in 09-10, and they did nothing on minimum wage, nothing on campaign finance, no public option in ACA. We can't keep letting them blame Republicans, because they could have done anything during those years, and they declined. If they had a plan to do it, don't you think they would have done it then?
2016-04-20	Great, but he might want to stop waging war with his own party, suing them and calling them corrupt. :-/
2016-04-20	Pointing out that big money influences the political system is not "waging war," and it's 100% true.
2016-04-20	I agree with you Michael
2016-04-20	Brian Cairns It's waging war to be repeating the message over and over again ad nauseum that the party and its presumptive nominee are corrupt beyond repair. All that will accomplish at this juncture is to discourge his folowers from goiog to the polls in November and supporting HRC, and we all know what happened in 2014 when people claiming to be liberals, progressives and liberal-leaning independents stayed home pouting on the couch.      Bernie's message about reform and justice is critical to the future of the party and that's what he should stick to.
2016-04-20	Don't do it Bernie! Go Independent! The DNC is dead to me!
2016-04-20	I say that he, and we, should give the party an opportunity to move substantially to the left and commit to rejecting corporate money. If they decline, or just pander (most likely), then Green or Independent all the way.
2016-04-20	thanks fred , always nice to hear from a Trump supporter
2016-04-20	Brian Cairns Going bravely into a Trump administration. Or perhaps you're more of a Cruz supporter. No matter; in either case you'll be able to sit in your hot tub & moan about this or that and that "the people" have let you down, refused to see the brilliance of your argument, and therefore deserve what they most assuredly will get.
2016-04-20	I call bull***t
2016-04-20	A Democrat for convenience. Go back to being an "independent". Don't want you in our party.
2016-04-20	Heinrich Wald, the democratic party left me, I didn't leave them. I am an old school liberal, not a "new democrat."
2016-04-20	Terry Underwood , let me guess, this is your excuse for not voting, none of the liberals are "liberal" enough for you. The extreme liberals on the left remind me a good deal of the extreme conservatives, don't find a middle ground, it is my way or no way.
2016-04-20	Terry, the Democratic Party was never as "liberal" as many liberals think and it was NEVER socialist. Sanders should start his own party (or join the Green), but he wants a bigger platform because he wants to be the big fish. I'm not surprised so many of his supporters are white, lower economic level men.
2016-04-20	Only Ted Cruz could be more despised than Trump; it's an art that he's mastered and keeps working on.
2016-04-20	People miss the idea, CH, that Cruz has been very lucky to have Trump in the race. Trump is SO BAD that he g ives Cruz and his awfullness cover. If Trump hadn't run, Cruz would be the pariah. He'd be LONG gone from the race.
2016-04-20	David Kent -- actually, you have it backwards; Obama, by being far and away the worst president in U.S. history and inflicting more damage on the nation than any other president, is what created the demand for Trump in the first place.
2016-04-20	He's too good for them. They secretly want Gay Marriage, Baby Killing, ect.... but can't say it so they won't support the TRUE Conservative becasue he is NOT for those evil and perverted things.... He is too Christian for them.... plus...they don't want to come down on Illegal immigration........ Even Christians are not standing up for Cruz..... it is very tragic.... beyond tragic.
2016-04-20	And the cons aqre delusional enough to think this clown can win if they take the nomination away from Trump? How stupid are cons becoming?
2016-04-20	Exhibit A) 2012 GOP autopsy emphasizes need to attract the youth & Latino vote to be competitive in 2016      Answer : A geriatric white billionaire spewing forth epithets of murderous & raping Mexicans & calling for mass deportation and wall-building while picking fights with the Catholic Pope      Mission Accompmlished!      ...it's like Debbie Wasserman Shultz found the entrance to the Cave of Wonders or something
2016-04-20	Ideologiically conservatives understand Cruz would be much better. Polticially Cruz is more palatable to the Republican eletorate writ large than Trump. But you are correct both are horrible choices with the general electorate.
2016-04-20	As the old saying say: "What goes around, comes around".      We've all experienced acquaintances or co-workers who behave awfully. But it's not that common to be there when they get their "comeupance".      Well, we're here to see it with Cruz and it's fun to watch.      Ted, you simply cannot treat everyone you work with like trash and expect them to later support you. I've read that everyone who has ever worked with Cruz hates him. Or just about everyone.      So this is deserved and we're lucky to witness it.

2016-04-20	Katie Packer who the hell is she to think that she and her cronies count it is the VOTERS who do... get it woman VOTERS...VOTERS..VOTERS.
2016-04-20	What a waste of money 14.3 million dam you are all losers !!!!!!!
2016-04-20	"the bulk from a dozen six- and seven-figure contributions"      But that's the good kindf dark money....
2016-04-20	Yes ~ Go Hillary!
2016-04-20	I find this whole concept of Pac money obscene.
2016-04-20	"I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base."   --Hillary Clinton, speech at George Washington University, March 17, 2008.
2016-04-20	could it be, could it just possibly possibly be, that the 'major donors' are coming to lil' cruz because they know that as a politician who bends with the wind and will continue to need money to fund his campaign, he will be much easier to 'buy' than the trumpster, who is so rich in his own right that he can just tell the 'major donors' to 'fu*k off'? 'what'? you say. is this what american politics is all about?
2016-04-20	Could it be, could it just possibly be, that the "major donors" give a damn about they're country? Perhaps they're not as gullible as the 35% of primary voters who have been mesmerized by a moron who thinks judges write laws and that the states have no right to govern themselves. Hmm?
2016-04-20	People don't give money to a loser who only purpose is to be a spoiler. On top of that he is arrogant, is a hot head, and has a big ego.
2016-04-20	Mofo is always eating lol. 1400 on Papa Johns? Dude is a joke. All he did in new York was eat at every restaurant. That's not even a joke. Town Hall , stupid comment, food, town hall, stupid comment, food. ....
2016-04-20	at that one pizza place, he ate pizza and three whole bowls of pasta. it was pretty funny. christie i could see but...
2016-04-20	Robert Hewitt, he ate like he was getting electrocuted in the morning.
2016-04-20	$1.2 mil?   He's done. This loser won't make it to May 1, no matter how much he lies to himself.
2016-04-20	I agree ,,,but that means he will come back to OHIO to impose more harm and create more damage , and probably sign the Christian toilet bill
2016-04-20	Kathy Smelser I feel your pain.
2016-04-20	Well , OHIO Tax Payers are now on the hook for paying out Millions for security for Kasich ,,,,,must be aweful dangerous world to need that much security , to eat Pitza with a Fork , a Burger bigger than your head and eating a Pickle like you drink a cup of Tea ,,,,,Kasich is a True TAKER
2016-04-20	now do bernies
2016-04-20	ARREST THE CLINTONS NOW AND SAVE THE USA
2016-04-20	As a lifelong Democrat I am “GENUINELY ASHAMED” of not planning to vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton if she is my party’s candidate for President.   I would rather live with the shame of not supporting my party than to be an accomplice to the most irresponsible political decision in my lifetime. Hillary Rodham Clinton does not deserve our support
2016-04-20	"I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base."   --Hillary Clinton, speech at George Washington University, March 17, 2008.
2016-04-20	Post by Francisco V. (U of C)   Wow the Stock Market is Up again   & the lying Tea Bag Republicans   were WRONG. The Democrats &   Obama & Clinton & Krugman &   Reich & Hillary RAISED Taxes on   the selfish Tea Bag MILLIONAIRES   and the Economy is better !! The   FACTS (NOT fake Fox News lies):   * Obama WAS born in the USA...See More
2016-04-20	ROTFLMAO !!
2016-04-20	Fuck Ted Cruz and the whole fucking Tea Bag movement. They are nothing but a destructive group that will do nothing positive. Ted Cruz will take our counrty to hell.
2016-04-20	Tamoor Kayani Tami you do not seem like a good person. what does this have to do with trump?
2016-04-20	And the Ted Cruz campaign it literally buying delegates now. Trips to the Bahamas, new cars and out and out CASH. Cruz is all about dirty tricks. They got caught pulling enough of them in the early primary states, and now they’ve learned to be more discreet about it. He comes on with that syrupy, preacher voice and cadence. Cruz so bought and paid for. big oil, big pharma, big (insert fuck the people group here.) Slick fucking asshole. Cruz better go down in flames or we’re in deep shit.
2016-04-20	and what do you propose as the alternative? Sorry, but Rumpasaurus is not an option.
2016-04-20	''Ted Cruz and John Kasich arrived in person''   Trump will do a call in LOL
2016-04-20	got spam ?
2016-04-20	The GOP is definitely in trouble. Can't believe they - and the media! - act like all Trump has to do is behave a little nicer and then he'll be acceptable! ;^( What about his IDEAS! Let's have Japan get a nuclear weapon! Let's say insulting things to our allies and make more enemies! 90% of Hispanics and 70% of women hate him, me included. Don't know if there's any hope, but if there's a sliver, #NeverTrump better get busy!
2016-04-20	Get on board the Trump Train now... there is room for all!   Build that wall Mr. Trump... 10 feet higher!
2016-04-20	Diane Smit... I totally agree with you.. And the GOP in whole is a sad shameful lot... They are so hungry for the voters that are being programed by evil, hateful, bigot, racist Donald J. Trump, that they still can't and won't for the dignity and honor of their label disqualify Trump and move on without him. The longer the GOP take to say Never Trump, the more it appears that the GOP must secretly think just like Donald J. Trump, and that they are bigots, racist, and just as evil and shameful as he is. The whole world is watching the GOP and seeing how they are still handling Donald J. Trump with kid gloves. It amazes me how this long standing Republican Party is allowing this one evil man to completly destroy their whole party.. Didn't think and know that the GOP was that wimpy and weak...
2016-04-20	Wanda Grose-Datta - It is not racist to tell people to go home,just common sense
2016-04-20	Not to mention all the Cruz Super PAC attack ads that have been run against Kasich. But when have little things like facts ever mattered to Donald Trump?
2016-04-20	Funny how the article days Trump said something rhetorically. Virtually everything he says is rhetorical.
2016-04-20	The people of this great nation have an opportunity to change the narrative of bigotry, outrageous rhetoric and dogmatic party line messaging offered by some candidates for the republican presidential nomination. We can vote for the only candidate who has proven ability and understanding of economy and foreign policy. John Kasich understands the fiduciary duty expected of an elected official and he has shown that he can and will make the hard decisions required in the highest office in the land. It is no longer about the delegate math. We need a nominee who has integrity and a plan from day one, and who can win in November.
2016-04-20	So thats why the republicans don't like him!
2016-04-20	Your kidding, right? If they are just going to choose someone that hasn't been elected by the people and has only won one state the GOP will surely not choose Kasich. They will go with someone like Paul Ryan. People have voted and it is not Kasich they want.
2016-04-20	Kasich is the RNC's lapdog! F him and F the Establishment! Taking back our country from the sellout traitors who only line their pockets with our tax dollars and make themselves rich off the backs of the American middle Class!!!
2016-04-20	Trump said today that New Hamshire had a cocain problem his wall would fix. They have a heroin problem, that comes from Afganistan.
2016-04-20	Maybe you didn't hear about the half mile long tunnel found today from Mexico with something like half a ton of cocaine in it? Along with something like 3 tons of wacky tabaccy?
2016-04-20	Jamie Berry - How do walls stop tunnels again?
2016-04-20	Eric Balshan I was more referring to the part that in came from Mexico. But to answer your question, with a wall, there has to be some type of foundation in/underground. Might not be 20' deep, but all manners of sensors could be embedded in it to listen for tunnel construction. They already use sensors for that, also.
2016-04-20	kasich just keeps proving that he is an ESTABLISHMENT candidate, and that he has absolutely no shame as a man.
2016-04-20	Sanders used his extra cash on a private jet for a family Roman Holiday.
2016-04-20	Hillary blows
2016-04-20	Nic Jennings Your wit is staggering!
2016-04-20	Yeah, because that's how campaign finance law works: you can do whatever you want with campaign contributions. You win the internet for the second dumbest thing I've read today.
2016-04-20	This election cycle is kind of showing the limits of what carpetbombing a media market with campaign ads can do. While Sanders outspent Clinton in television advertisements (sometimes two to one) and have held large rallies (which cost a lot to rent a venue large enough to hold the attendees), the traditional retail politicking of going to churches, small events, community centers, local restaurants and other small-scale events still work best.
2016-04-20	it was 3 to 1 he outspent in NY. right now he is lying to his supporters that he has a chance to win, because he wants to keep their $$$ contrbutions coming for his own needs.   He knows he has never had a path for over 45 days...but it is the $$ what he wants.
2016-04-20	Jay Majumdar Absurd. Did you see Sander's tax return compared to Hillary's?? He made $200,000 in 2015 compared to Hillary the Crook's $17.6 MILLION. Who wants money? Tool.
2016-04-20	Vincent Ardizzone "Hillary the Crook?" LOL! Vincent is a "trumpster" diver. lol. No wonder! Carry on.
2016-04-20	outraises, outspends, outloses. BADUM TISS
2016-04-20	Deal with the facts. Trump spent 13 cents per vote, Sanders over $10. Who's the phony big money witch?
2016-04-20	How much money did the networks spend for trump? I heard is two billion so far...
2016-04-20	Adam Sinclair Even if that were so (which I doubt) the networks raked in many more millons in advertising due to the higher viewer numbers, which is why they cover Trump in the first place. It's not because they love him, clearly. It's more money for the networks...plain and simple.
2016-04-20	And it did how much good? That was a landslide, a real "clock cleaning":)
2016-04-20	Hillary said she used her private email server for work email for convenience - i.e. only have to carry one device (her Blackberry).      How convenient was that she didn't have access to her work email whenever she was at her office at the State Dept. as no mobile devices allowed?
2016-04-20	Cite your source that she said that and also that the State Dept doesn't allow mobile devices - like no one has a smart phone? LMAO
2016-04-20	Ada Waay - The State Department and the rest of the federal government use balackberry's because they are compatible with government ecryption while Iphones and other smart phone platforms are not.
2016-04-20	Todd Smith The US gov prefers the BlackBerry, but they allow Android and iOS. And I would think most in the government would recognize how secure the latter smartphone is.
2016-04-20	I hope that finally the moronic sheep comprehend (as said by their macho) that indicting Mrs. Clinton is an impossibility.
2016-04-20	No--the moronic sheep are The Clinton apologists who have no earthly idea of the facts of this case because they believe anybody with a (D) behind their name. Clinton was careless at best--grossly negligent at worst. If the FBI reccomends indictment and the Obama controlled Justice Dept chooses not to pursue charges then we can safely assume that Obama is protecting Clinton. It would have nothing to do with guilt or innocence. What is sad to me is that folks voting for Clinton are so far gone in their partisanship that they would potentially nominate someone who at the very least was so secretive and/or so careless (or clueless according to Hillary herself) regarding classified information. And I might add that the classified information ranged from the lowest levels of classification to the very highest. Furthermore, the SAP level information in her emails was indeed classified at the time it was sent according to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Agencies.
2016-04-20	I love the assumptions based on facts not in evidence..   I assume you also consider Rice and Powell to be criminally negligent as well especially since they destroyed all of thier emails to cover up the criminal acts they commited?
2016-04-20	Ooops, there goes the only hope of the racists...
2016-04-20	Stay in Mexico . You might get your testicles hung up on the border fence , chinga !
2016-04-20	Dean Smallwood That comment says that you are a rascist asshole. Thanks for showing us your stupidity.
2016-04-20	Jan Elvira ....well his last name is "small wood" so.....maybe he's trying to over compensate for something.
2016-04-20	Hillary probably won't be indicted......but the FBI, DOJ leaks about what she actually did will be more damaging. What a 'dunce' she is.....started when she was fired from the Watergate investigations/hearings back in the early 70's....wow!....has she been around since the early 70s?! Yikes!....but, yo, she is the first black female prez candidate....EVER! So historic!   Gag US WITH A FIST!
2016-04-20	Jerry, source please regarding the "firing"..
2016-04-20	Umm... And Hillary is white. You might as well as not commented because wrong, wrong, wrong. Speak about dunces. Research a little more. And that continuing urban myth that she was fired during Watergate never has been proven. She was 27 years old and still you guys cannot move on.
2016-04-20	That ridiculous Watergate myth was debunked ages ago.
2016-04-20	If there is a 12 investigation.....Please! Please! Please let Penguin (Trey Gowdy) chair this investigation!
2016-04-20	12th
2016-04-20	If you voted for a Conservative, here is what you got:   - 25 Benghazi investigations, all of which discovered nothing   - 15 investigations of Hillary’s email server, all of which discovered nothing   - 50 Repeal Obamacare bills, none of which had a chance in hell of becoming law   - 1 KY Pipeline Bill, which failed   - a bill to allow people on the no-fly list to purchase pistols and rifles   - a heartfelt discussion of gay marriage   Be Proud, Conservatives, Be Proud!
2016-04-20	Hank Marcus pull your head out of Obama's ass !
2016-04-20	Sure, instead of asking him about the issues, let's ask him the same question we've already asked him 100 times, with the same answer given every single time. I'd get irritated with that too. Media, #DoYourJob
2016-04-20	he has ZERO chance of being president so what other relevant question would you like to ask him?
2016-04-20	Why is he still running? Why isn't he back in Ohio doing his job?
2016-04-20	Brian Morrisey, are you from Ohio?
2016-04-20	It's only that he seems more rational than the other 2 clowns; but his basic policies - lower taxes on the wealthy, destroy unions, control women's lives, spend fortunes on military - are the same uber-right Republican orthodoxy.      Don't be fooled by Kasich's smie - he's just another tool
2016-04-20	Yes, the last thing we want is a balanced budget, a strong military and politicians who are willing to talk to the opposition party.
2016-04-20	Richard Joseph we had a balanced budget until the last R came along - George W Bush and his tax cuts for the wealthy and his "whatever the defense contractors want" military spending
2016-04-20	A Trump ticket or a Cruz ticket would loose just like if Sara Palin was on a ticket. Oh she was. See
2016-04-21	SANDERS XSHIT SPENT $45.7 million I HOPE HIS BACKERS THINK THEY GOT VALUE FOR MONEY, POS SANDERS KNOWS HE IS A LOSER BUT IS PREPARED TO SPENT $45.7 million IN THE PURSUIT OF A LOSS. WHAT A STINKING XARSOLE SANDERS IS. HE MOANS ABOUT WALL ST WHILE W A S T E S $45.7 million ON HIS EGO TRIP............. WHERE ARE YOU STINKING SANDERS???? STILL HIDING IN VT AND AVOIDING THE MEDIA AFTER YOU GOT C R U S H E D IN NEW YORK???????????
2016-04-21	Steve, Sanders knows by now he will lose this nomination, but his followers have given him a boatload of money to hear him continue his message.....and I say bravo, but it is time for both of these candidates to stop snipping at each other.
2016-04-21	Lol. LET'S ALL POST IN CAPITAL LETTERS. got scammed in NY is the truth. Glad to see the pro corruption crowd out tonight.
2016-04-21	Terry Underwood no that money is for the independent run Bernie will be firing up in a few short weeks. The idea that Hillary & the dnc could cheat their way to victory & expect the people with integrity to support her is absurd. 42% of the voting population are independents & we know who they overwhelmingly support.
2016-04-21	Is this taking into account the funds raised by clinton through illegal campaign financing? No? How about the money spent through superpacs? No? Okay no corporate media slant here.
2016-04-21	The democratic party better move the convention because it's about to get crazy. You can't cheat your way to victory & expect the people with integrity to now support OBVIOUS corruption. We're sending more money to bernie to start his independent run in the general.   On his way out the door of the convention we only ask that he make one statement. A quote from Walter Sobchak from the big lebowski " this is what happens when you f*ck a stranger in the a**" lol.
2016-04-21	I am with you all the way! I didn't make that deal with Hillary Clinton, that if she protected that serial rapist, she'd get to be president. I will never help them keep that deal either! The DNC can BERN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2016-04-21	Hillary Clinton was promised a long time ago if she stood by her man and kept her mouth shut. About a serial rapist who is no better than Bill Cosby! But because he's white and was the president he's being treated differently. I didn't make that deal. I'm not willing to help her climb over the broken bodies of those raped and molested women to become president! As a lifelong Democrat I would never vote for her ! That's the honest truth. So who do I have to turn to? Bernie Sanders! The only candidate that should be running right now. Hillary Clinton should recuse herself on many grounds. Namely that they cheated in the Democratic primary in New York. Republicans plan to indict Hillary Clinton mid general election ! She will never be the president. We must have an alternative! And in fact we have someone who's actually better qualified to be the president then she is Bernie Sanders! Because of his judgement.
2016-04-21	By the way Bernie Sanders did win almost every County in New York! Except for the places where there were large voter purges imagine that?
2016-04-21	Louis Tash there was no mass corruption in the NY race, just excuses by the losers to explain their losses. As for Bernie winning most of the rest of the state.....take a look at the vote counts there. In many cases, Bernie won with a few hundred votes (in one county he won 68-32% but if you look at the count....he won by 83 votes) while in NYC, Hillary won by 10s of thousands (she won Queens County by 46,000 votes alone).
2016-04-21	Cheryl Onstad The NY election official who was suspended yesterday begs to differ!
2016-04-21	he "loaned" the campaign money. So he will be paid back with Interest by his other contributers and probably gets a huge tax break as well. Don't be fooled people, he is not a politician but he IS the establishment - PERIOD. "trickle down" economics does not work, this has been proven over and over and over again. see Kansas for a perfect example and trump wants to double down. Sure him and a few of his buddies will save around 250 billion dollars just in taxes but everybody else will burn. There is only one candidate running who is there for the rest of us and he WILL get the majority vote if we stand together against the corruption. Feel the Bern...
2016-04-21	Bernie sounds more like Trump everyday. Claims that he will do something with no discussion of how it will be done. He also is like Trump in claiming that the system is rigged against him. Electing either is the same.

2016-04-21	>Hannity then concluded by saying the delegate process needs to be more transparent going forward, remarking that every delegate needs to be unbound.      So he thinks there should be no primaries?
2016-04-21	no, they just need to all favour Drumpf obviously!
2016-04-21	If this is the process than they should all be unbound. The party has stated that they pick the nominee, not the voters. So let them do it without taxpayer funding for primary elections that don't matter anyway.

2016-04-21	The luna-fkn-tic right is imploding over their refusal to buy each other's bullshit.
2016-04-21	As the dnc steals the election for hillary.      shut up already.
2016-04-21	Two things come to mind. Firstly, Hannity is nothing but a Drumpf shill. End of. And secondly, Drumpf is kicking off about these delegates because - being the smart-arse he is - he thought they weren't worth campaining for. Now that it turns out they could potentially make the difference he's screaming murder. The reality is the (admittedly weird) rules have been in place for over 12 months. If you aren't able to understand delegate contests or be bothered to do your homework then you're clearly unfit for the job.
2016-04-21	Trump is unfit for the job but that's another story. The most important thing he has done is pull back a curtain on a process that is funded by taxpayers yet gives them no power to select the nominee.
2016-04-21	Have you seen the way Hannity looks at Trump when he interviews him?? Talk about a mancrush!!!!!
2016-04-21	Sarah Harper wow, same neocon crap like they threw at Reagan.... history does repeat itself.
2016-04-21	Boycotting Hannity from now own. It's been so obvious where he has stood all along and he thinks we are stupid. He talks about Hilary trying to cover up. The interviews are like day and night with Trump and Cruz. Even when cruz got an interview its all about Trump and I dont even k ow who I'm going to vote for so you can't say I'm partial to Cruz. Just can't believe Fox news. We can't trust anybody to be fair any more. At least Mark Levin and Glenn Beck tell you who they're for and don't try to hide and say they are not when they are. Shame on you Hannity. Thought you were a better man than that.
2016-04-21	It’s odd how Hannity would go on and on about looking at Obama’s past and who he associated with (Bill Ayers, J. Wright, etc) in order to better determine who he is. However, Hannity completely ignores Trump’s recent liberal positions (abortion) and political donations (Hillary, Reid, etc). Oh, Trump claims he is conservative now, but why and how? Trump and Hannity point to the fact that Reagan was a Democrat, but Reagan actually articulated why he changed parties (and it was the movement of the parties positions, not Reagan’s beliefs).
2016-04-21	Christopher Marciano seriously?? Trump has said over and over again why he changed his position on abortion from MANY YEARS AGO. Trump has been a registered republican since the 1980's--he has said on many occasions when he was younger (30 years ) he would run for president if or country was ever in trouble. His contributions were done as a businessman to both sides--and recently learned he gave Ted Cruz the most moey. many many people believe everything they read on the internet sad to say---do your research---I have been following Trump for years and know him to be a true patriot.
2016-04-21	For the man who complains about the process being "rigged" (which has many merits). he now wants to "rig" the primary so he can hit 1.237, which he may not if Cruz and Kasich stay in the race?
2016-04-21	Why?
2016-04-21	At this point, Cruz and Kasich are spoilers! Mathematically they don't stand a chance.
2016-04-21	Ted Cruz simply has no legitimate way to become the Republican nominee. He is behind in number of states, way behind on delegates and millions more vote for Trump. Even if he somehow does some back-room dealing to get the party nomination, he will alienate 1/2 the Republican party. After that he is DOA in the general election. Seriously... if he cannot even win his party nomination (except through backroom dealings) he lost 1/2 the (R) base. His personality is creepy and strange. So, in summary, he lost 1/2 the Republican base, the center won't go for his personality and Hillary is popular with her party. Ted Cruz has a narcistic personality that will do NOTHING but harm the Republican party in November if he somehow slimes his way into a convention victory. Cruz needs to be marginalized from within the party.
2016-04-21	a soft-ball interview with Trump and his family   he was right there with his 2 daughters and wife   why not ask one of the daughters "do you agree with your father that a woman should not have the right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy"   why not ask the wife "do you agree with your husband that an 'an eye for an eye' is the most important part of the Bible"   why not ask the son "did your father abuse you like his father abused him"
2016-04-21	Listen to your porn star wife. She actually makes more sense than you do. Gawd knows your kids are a brood of twits so don't ask them anything. They can't even vote. What a sorry lot.

2016-04-21	"Libya, right now, as you know, has fantastic oil, some of the finest oil in the world." ~ Truthful Hyperbole      “The final key to the way I promote is bravado. I play to people’s fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That’s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.   I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration—and a very effective form of promotion”      Excerpt From: Donald J. Trump. “Trump: The Art of the Deal.” iBooks.
2016-04-21	They say even death can't cure an idiot.   -Ririn”
2016-04-21	Ian Blake and you're living proof that nothing an cure idiocracy.
2016-04-21	But Libya does have oil, and ISIS is taking it, and they're selling it on the black market. What's your point?
2016-04-21	Hard to disagree with Trump on this one. Everything we do seems to make it worse, lets do nothing.
2016-04-21	another insightful comment by donnie. he makes lots of them, if you bother to listen.

2016-04-21	He's right. He'd rather drill here, than depend on the mid east.
2016-04-21	All you have to do is substitute Trump's picture for one of Sarah Palin and leave the exact same word salad. Trump is Palin 2.0      ""One of the things that -- running for office is interesting. They'll ask you questions like that," Trump said during a town-hall discussion on NBC's "Today." "I said that from the beginning. They never did it. Then they started it, on a limited basis. Libya, right now, as you know, has fantastic oil, some of the finest oil in the world. Who has the oil? ISIS has the oil. Do we blockade it, bomb it, do anything? No. ISIS is making a fortune now in Libya."
2016-04-21	Trump is correct in my opinion. Why do we have to erase a person in order to add a person? As Greta VanSustern said, why not add a twenty-five dollar bill? Then, put Harriet Tubman on it. This bill would be used quite often, and we wouldn't have to treat Andrew Jackson as if he were unimportant. I am sick of political correctness.
2016-04-21	Nobody's been "erased." He simply won't be on the $20 bill. Didn't the political correctness of another time dictate that everyone pictured on our money is a white male?
2016-04-21	"Why do we have to erase a person in order to add a person? "      The cost of additional bills is too high. Cash registers have only so many drawers. Automated sorting machine all over the planet would be affected.

2016-04-21	Harriet Tubman was an amazing woman. Well known for her military strategy and willingness to repeatly risk her life to free others. I applaud the decision. Did you know she was known to hide all day long in a pile of manur to elude capture. She gave everything and them some.      "Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within in you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world." Harriet Tubman quote.
2016-04-21	Ramon F. Herrera Don't you have a Sarah Palin slam to post somewhere???
2016-04-21	Trump is going to want his picture on the million dollar bill.
2016-04-21	I say we put him on the trillion dollar bill, and then use that to pay off the debt the Chinese hold, then tell the Chinese we don't have change.
2016-04-21	LMAO
2016-04-21	After if crashes the economy and we're all pushing wheel barrows fulls of dollars to buy bread (like Germany before Hitler) - because his economic policies would have that result.
2016-04-21	Everything is political. The fact that we only have white males on our currency is political. Our society has traditionally enforced and reinforced white male power. It's just now that there are movements towards greater inclusivity, that white males are freaking out. Anything that threatens the status quo is "PC gone wild".
2016-04-21	Isabella Mit Lincoln, Grant and FDR are not founding fathers, and I'm not racist or sexist against white males. I married one!

That is until the righties wanted to suck up to their base and make it an issue. As you say, "the way it is" has heen the way it was for a long time due to common sense. Just not the way you see it.

2016-04-21	She is relying on fear of her opponant to make us support her. Again from Hillary, the politics of fear. You gotta admire how callous, calculating, and amoral she is. It's kind of like watching a jackal.      HRC, I can't speak for everyone. Trust me on this, I will vote my courage, not my fear. I will vote for the candidate that I believe is a decent person, supports a platform that I support, and if there are none, I will write in Bernard Sanders. I will never allow my vote to be dominated by the politics of fear again. No matter how much urine and feces you spread around to try to mark your territory, it will never encompass me.
2016-04-21	I'm 68 in body years--and, fortunately, know that a lifetime of civic experience compels me to agree with Bryan Davis. I will not cast my vote into the gutter. I'll write in Bernie Sanders for President. And between now and then--there's still the FBI investigation into Hillary's e-mail server scandal. Keep on keepin' on, Bernie!! You're right to fight on for the future of America!! And I put my money where my heart is--as a regular contributor to his campaign. He's the best and most positive financial investment I've made in my entire life.
2016-04-21	Well, Bryan, you darn well better vote your fear this November. Unless (like me) you're an old white guy, you and the country-maybe the entire world-will suffer for decades from the policies espoused by whatever crawls out of Cleveland. Of course, you may feel that none of that will matter to YOU as you sit in your hot tub moaning about the lack of Purity in polotics...

2016-04-21	With HIllary, it's a few things:   - Her delivery. Flat, like a goose honking or a donket braying. Like listening to several New year's Eve party horns- blaaaat!   - Her delivery. She talks to us as though we Americans are a herd of inept children. A classroom of slack-jawed dullards. That need her to protect us from Life.   - Scolding. HIllary is big on scolding, as is Obama, who tried it on Putin ("You are on   the wrong side of history!") Putin ate his lunch alongside Assad. Hillary was the salad course.
2016-04-21	G.R.   Hey Skeeter, your brain must be stuck in "idiot 'merkun stupid" since you're obviously confusing Cruz, Donnie or Kasick with Hillary.

2016-04-21	Is it just me, or is it reasonable to expect a comedienne - when imitating a public figure - to actually IMMITATE that public figure? I never liked Poehler as Clinton because she didn't do one thing - other than be about Hillary's height, build and hair color - to impersonate her. I remember one skit with Poehler and Clinton when Poehler giggled over and over. Clinton asked: Do I giggle like that?      Answer: No. I'm not actually immitating you.      I know... get a life, right?
2016-04-21	Like anybody has asked a tough question to St. Bernie,like where are your 2011 taxes you know the ones where you ripped off a couple hundred kid at that college of yours to a tune of 1000 bucks apiece.With your wifes cronyism/nepotism job.Housewife to college president happens all the time if your husband happens to be the sitting senator of the state.
2016-04-21	You left out shipping nuclear waste out of VT to a non-english speaking community in Texas. Or my personal favorite...Bernie took $$$ from a SuperPAC for his 2006 campaign. Whose SuperPAC you ask? Hillary's !!! Oh, the irony. Look, exchanging character attacks is an utter waste of time and completely unproductive. It's hard to resist though when Bernie and his supporters take such "holier-than-thou" attitudes. As a former supporter...if Bernie does as currently stated...contest the convention against Hillary, I for one will never forgive him or support him.
2016-04-21	What? A moment of actual sanity???

2016-04-21	What a guy. Yep but if a women gets an abortion when Donald Trump is President, they will be punished by law. What one hand taketh away the other one bringith it right back.
2016-04-21	Women in Texas are being forced to give birth to still borns because of the fetal heart beat law. Even though the FETUS is not viable, they have to wait until it dies inside them before getting the procedure. And, as soon as it dies, it turns to poison inside the mother's womb. They have to endure the pain and suffering of both themselves and the fetus as it slowly dies. One woman had to be sedated because she was crying "get this thing out of me!".   Yeah, we can all see how much the GOP cares about their women. Why any woman would want to live in a GOP controlled state is beyond me.
2016-04-21	Don't sleep aroud like cra, then she won't be having any fetal defects as well. No suprise whores and their background, communities do every damage imaginable.
2016-04-21	CM Vst The stupid in you is strong.
2016-04-21	CM Vst - LOL. You honestly believe birth defects are cause by having sex? Whomever brought you to America on an H1B needs to have their head examined. As a matter of fact, would you please return to India so an American have your job?
2016-04-21	How adorable.      The short-fingered vulgarian has begun his pivot to the middle.      Sorry, Der Donald. We're not falling for it.      Most of America isn't as dense as your supporters.
2016-04-21	Poor Donald, he hasn't learned that you aren't even allowed to say the word "abortion" at the convention. "Fear" and "Hate" are mandatory.
2016-04-21	How hilarious - a majority of delegate to the Republican Convention will never go along with this. Just what the Repubican paerty needs - more division and more drama to expose just how radical they are. Does Donald know he doesn't getr to writ the platform?
2016-04-21	No!

2016-04-21	Scott Henricks Don't you all know that Trump thinks he's running for King?!!!? He can order the military to break the law; he will write and change laws and treaties; he will force other countries to do what he wants. THIS, after insulting and demeaning them all. He wants to be King - of the U.S., and preferably the World. He's the only one with an ego big enough to think he'd be the best King of the World God ever made!
2016-04-21	I 100% agee with Trump on this issue and I hink Donald is up to his old trick of dominating news cyles by tweaking the GOP establshment. I will say this for him. He knows how to get her done as far as clinching the nomination. Trump absolutely owns the media, he as turned it into his own personel publicity firm. Well played mister Trump not that I want you to win but I have to give credit where it is due.
2016-04-21	Transgender people and use of bathrooms have NEVER been an issue until, as usual, to appeal to the base, and to discriminate against gay people, the Republicans get out the pitchforks to attack a non problem. Same as those "voter ID laws" that were designed to disenfranchise people. Same as protecting people's "religious liberties" which thinly disguises giving people permission to discriminate.      We know this GOP show by now.      And I thought that the GOP was all for businesses being able to fire people at will.
2016-04-21	So you are fine with a grown man sharing a bathroom with your daughter??
2016-04-21	Curt Peterson How will this law stop that if that grown man is determined to share that bathroom?
2016-04-21	Transgender people using the bathrooms has NEVER been an issue until the left started passing laws forcing people to allow them to use whatever bathroom they choose. You want to act like the GOP started this, but you are dead wrong. The left created this issue and now wants to look like the victim - again.
2016-04-21	Having seen the latest poll numbers, I don't think people really give a shit what Cruz has to say....
2016-04-21	Cruz is right. End of story.
2016-04-21	Cruz will never be president. End of Story
2016-04-21	You posted a story about a man killing a boy in a restroom as proof that transgenders are dangerous. A man dressed like a man is not transgender.      Your opinion has been proven wrong by posting proof you don't know what transgender even means, just a blind fool.
2016-04-21	How is your state's economy these days?
2016-04-21	The law signed by the Governor in North Carolina about access to bathrooms is unconstitutional and violates federal law. Sorry the truth hurts. The second truth that hurts is that Schilling had every right to tweet what he wanted to tweet. No one arrested him. However the consequences of his speech gives the right to ESPN to fire him. These are two perfect examples as to why Ted Cruz is very dangerous for the US. He is so smitten by religion and extreme he would harm us all if he became President.http://www.usatoday.com/.../north-carolina.../82872840/
2016-04-21	How is it unconstitutional? The extremism is letting men into ladies rooms as well (not just Cruz), and forcing that on people, most who are not comfortable with it in many religions and backgrounds. The people who molest may not be transgender, but the hundreds of molesters and rapists in every state will certainly see it as an opportunity. The selfishness of making a few more comfortable emotionally rather than the vast majority safer seems to be lost on those who are blindly fighting for this. If a person actually changes their sex then they can go in that bathroom. Until their anatomy changes please respect other people's discomfort and concern for their children. I've known way too many people harmed for life by predators.
2016-04-21	Theresa McMahon Chorlian Apparently you did not read the article posted from USA today. It has been codefied for years. It is the fringe that have just now reacted to this. A little too late to be complaining I would have to say.
2016-04-21	So it's OK for Dennis Hassert to look at little boys taking a shower sitting in his LAZY BOY CHAIR after practice. Consertative values working out just fine.
2016-04-21	Are you for real? As a conservative, I will condemn Dennis Hassert all day long. They guy is a scum bag.
2016-04-21	Curt Peterson But Rafael won't..
2016-04-21	Curt Peterson -Kudos to you! Know that I am a progressive, but I admire your willingness to not just ... tow-the-company line. Life must be hard for you right now as a conservative. Seriously, we need a two party system, one to focus on expansion and one to focus on contraction. What has been lost is the desire for balance between the two.
2016-04-21	Sorry, Joe, Sanders IDEAS are big, but the wallets of the Rich, Corporations, Middle Class and Poor couldn't even fund his ideas. Big is one thing, Fake Fantasy is another.
2016-04-21	Hillary Assad Trump is your only hope left, he doesn't like Bush or Clinton. :)
2016-04-21	Yet all of his proposals we have already done as a nation at one time or another. Its what are business model was in the 50's and 60's. Its the time that the baby boomers look back on so fondly because "America was Great" without realizing it was the policies of their parents generation that created the America they are so fond of. And when I hear people like yourself saying it cant be done I just laugh at the brainwashing you allow for yourself. When just a little research into our American history will show you the truth. Its not that we cant do it. Its that people, like yourself, have been scared into thinking we cant do it. All the while Profiteering runs rabid in our country destroying the very foundation that makes our country great.
2016-04-21	If you make 50k you will see a 500.00 increase in taxes to offset the 5000k you normally pay in healthcare fees. Anybody under 250k will not see an increase. Stop spreading misinformation.

All and all we got a lot of change from the Bush/Republican years. We must keep it going.

This Is the Undeniable Proof...      http://survivemagazine645.blogspot.com   This is Donald Trump's most shocking statement yet,      However the mainstream media isn't saying a word about it!      What are they really trying to cover up?   I'm sending this to all my friends, family and patriot brothers......See More
2016-04-21	Cinni Valdez Rico You are dead wrong. The Housing bubble was not predicted by Trump. But it was a result of the Clintons along with the massive incarceration of low level offenders in their prisons for profi. Trump is completely unqualifed to be president. He is a unprincipled real estae magnet and if you would pick up a book you would know that. He has ripped on SO many vendors who built hotels for him. Then he simply says when to invoice comes due to "sue me", which he knoes they cannot afford to do.He appeals to the lowest common denominator. Ask yourself why a Billionaire would want to be POTUS. It is not to help anyone. It is because he is a rich man angling for the ultimate accomplishment.   And if you are going to cite a source use a reputable and honest one. You are far from a patriot.
2016-04-21	Cinni Valdez Rico Damn you are dense. Hundreds of thousands? That is why the middle class is disappearing. We are being reamed by the right. And the only thing you can do is post nonsense and conspiracy theories that are totally irrelevant today.
2016-04-21	ah, and some hollywood actor speaks his wisdom which isn't much, but it is more than what clown clooney and little fella dicaprio have
2016-04-21	And snark is so helpful and wise. George Clooney has donated time and tons of money to help the disenfranchised. DiCaprio has donated time and tons of money to help the environment. What have you done, Ron?
2016-04-21	Ron what did he say that offended you so?
2016-04-21	Cheryl Onstad " what did he say that offended you so?"   ================   "The distinguishing characteristic of the Conservative brain, according to scientists, is the capacity for outrage. Conservatives are easily outraged over anything, no matter how trivial, and you want to ban it, outlaw it, control it, stamp it out, etc.      "Scientists can spot a Conservative brain using brain scans now.      "Take for example the existence of gay Americans. Conservatives CANNOT STAND the fact that gays exist in the world, even though the presence of gays in our society cause no one any trouble of any kind.      "Conservatives, like gays, are born, not made. You inherited your Conservatism, your shoe size, and your hair color with your family's DNA".
2016-04-21	I am extremely disappointed at Tom Hanks, for having helped keep the biggest line in the history of America. He knows VERY well that in 1963 a great injustice was done, one which continues to this day.      He keeps on sustaining the freakin lie, in his movies:      http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2345112/?ref_=nm_flmg_prd_15   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3342338/?ref_=nm_flmg_prd_14   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3682448/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_7
2016-04-21	Ramon and what lie is that?
2016-04-21	Cheryl Onstad : The coup d'etat. November 22, 1963.
2016-04-21	Oh no... Another JFK conspiracy theorist freak who is extremely disappointed in Hanks?? Lighten up and knock this crap off. Where were you on 11-22-63? Were you born? I remember the exact moment and what Hanks was asked has absolutely nothing to do with JFK. You're an idiot.
2016-04-21	There are 4 clearly aligned positions in the case of JFK's murder.      Each group has a well defined motivation.
2016-04-21	(1) Liberal Conspiracy Theorists      This group is still grieving by the horrible crime. They feel robbed of a demigod who reached mythic proportions. Their source of frustration is the breach of the trust between the government and The People, an injustice that has been unresolved for too long.      Oliver Stone, John Kerry (best friend of Teddy), all the Kennedys, Clintons, Gore, Jeff Morley, Ramon Herrera.
2016-04-21	(2) Liberal Lone Nutters      These folks are terrified about the real possibility that LBJ had something to do with it:      Chris Mathews, Jimmy Carter, Larry Sabato, Robert Allbritton, who is the Founder of Politico and Member of the Trustees of the LBJ Library, etc.      I have the feeling Rachel Maddow is closeted CT but must follow MSNBC policy.
2016-04-21	The position of the right is more interesting. Per their nature, it is rooted on hatred. It hinges on what they hate the most.      Conservative/Republicans:      (3) Conservative Lone Nutters:      They hate the Democratic Party the most.      "It was a freakin' commie!! One of your own!!! Oswald did it to impress Fidel!!"...See More

This has almost nothing to do with the environmental policy anymore, with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole,” said Edenhofer, who co-chaired the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group on Mitigation of Climate Change from 2008 to 2015.      So what is the goal of environmental policy?      “We redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy,” said Edenhofer.   http://www.investors.com/.../another-climate-alarmist.../

2016-04-21	Last sentence of article is what concerns gun owners most. We all agree there are too many illegal guns on streets, but the number in homes and neighborhoods is irrelevant unless your true aim is confiscation. As a law abiding, responsible gun owner, the number of guns I own is not business of government nor a concern for neighbors. Gum owners are tired of being told the only way to reduce crime is restrict the rights of those who have broken no laws. When did the government get the power to punish me for the actions of others?

2016-04-21	"I just don't like to see [gun violence] be politicized." Wow, Jane, seems like you stole that line right out of the GOP gun rights playbook. Maybe Jane should have ended her remarks with letting the victims know they have Bernie's 'thoughts and prayers' to really complete the GOP gun talking points. But frankly, Bernie has admitted he plays politics with guns, or maybe you forget the first debate when Bernie admitted he hasn't been as tough on guns because he saw guns as an urban problem, and he represents a rural state with lots of gun owners.

2016-04-21	Honestly, I would vote for him, except for those tiny little hands. I mean look at those things. How is he even going to press the nuke button to blow up China? He would have to pound at it with his tiny fist in the hopes that it would somehow go off. It looks like he could easily fit his little fist in his mouth with room left over.      He speaks to my inner xenophobia and all my darkest fears and desires, so I would vote for him based on that, but I just can't get over those miniature little fingers attached to that tiny hand. That is not the hand of a world leader.

2016-04-21	The Iowa caucus was another robbery. Just ask Dr. Ben Carson. Imagine,   the Cruz campaign telling Iowa voters that Dr. Carson had dropped-out.   And, putting phony "election violation forms on their houses." So the first   primary was a scam job. I wish that Dr. Carson would have taped one of those phony election violation forms on Cruz's podium just before the next   GOP debate was underway. The media, as a group, had very little to say   about what the Cruz campaign had done. Cruz fires his campaign manager; so what?   CNN hires him to speak against Trump for the next few months. The media   dropped the story. So much for the media. Nothing was done at the local,   state or federal level, to right these nefarious actions. Carson's campaign was effectively over. Cruz got his first "victory," albeit a tainted one.
2016-04-21	John Kinsey No only that but he celebrated his voterless victories in Colorado. Where the GOP leaders kicked out Trump delegates and switch their numbers to Cruz. Cruz bought out the entire Colorado GOP.
2016-04-21	John Kinsey, this was what prompted Trump to say that he is much worse than a New York real estate person.   Trump knows, he is not perfect, but he was astonished how indecent Cruz is.

2016-04-21	Baloney. If Trump becomes president, he will achieve immigration reform faster than you can shake a stick. If he builds the wall, so what. He's also going to provide a path for citizenship for 11 million people. He's not going to be doing any mass deportation. His top advisors on immigration will straighten him out about that. But he'll be a lot stricter on border enforcement and that will appease his followers. As for banning all Muslims, that's a crock as well. He'll tighten up visas and other things that make it more difficult for terrorists to get into the country and his followers...See More

2016-04-21	" If Trump becomes president, he will achieve immigration reform faster than you can shake a stick."   =======      Without the support of Congress? The Senate will be Democrat with total certainty.
2016-04-21	Trump did far more than spook moderates he's also spooked those who would have voted for Republicans. This is a situation where a candidate has harmed the party by building a base of support for himself. No national party can alienate immigrants and expect to grow in this country. What Trump did was carve out a group of xenophobic Republicans that is the new face of the GOP. Trump's success should result in bad news down the ticket.
2016-04-21	Nobody seems to be able to differentiate between legal immigrants and trespassers. They lump them all together in order to shield those in the country illegally from the title they deserve.
2016-04-21	Richard M. Gulbrandsen      We need to end all immigration, legal and illegal. We have too many people and not enough of anything else.      If there are 12-20 million illegals in the US, there must be at least 5-10 million EMPLOYERS of illegals in the US. Those employers would be easy to find and easy to audit. Prosecutors can easily prove that a particular employer is breaking minimum wage laws, Medicare reporting laws, social security reporting laws, income tax reporting laws, and probably a number of state laws governing employers.      1. Let's fast-track a process to put about 100,000 of those felo...See More
2016-04-21	Richard M. Gulbrandsen Hogwash, its an easy decision in yours and other xenophobic minds. Immigration goes back to the beginning of time with peoples crossing borders for all kinds of reasons. You want to stop an age old problem its not going to happen with lame solutions like walls. We have a huge population and the number of illegals which goes up and down constantly. Xenphobia is not going to solve it at all.
2016-04-21	Drug runners will have a thousand tunnels under Trumps ego wall before the paint dries.   He's such a jackass.   No clue...
2016-04-21	You're the jackass for not being capable of seeing that he's the only candidate concerned about this issue, and will implement actual efforts to halting the flow of endless amounts of South Americans.      What's wrong with you people? You lack such critical thinking skills that it scares me. Every other candidate will throw you under the bus in order to appease non-citizens and minorities. He's literally the only sensible candidate and is aware of the dangers to a society where illegal immigration is praised. You're an idiot, dunno why I'm even trying to convince you of something that should be easily discernable.

This is patently false... If trump gets even 10 delegates from Indiana, he would still win... The pivotal state is PA since it has 54 unbound delegates of which Trump would only need about 30 to be over the 1237 needed...

2016-04-21	Yeah, I don't expect the New York GOP to help in the stop Trump movement.      Even before this announcement most of the party leaders were already backing Trump. Frankly, as bad a general election candidate that Trump is, he'll run better than someone like Cruz in New York since he has the home state advantage of 6 or 7 points.      He won't win NY by a longshot, but the NY GOP probably figure he can help in their suburban and upstate races more than someone like Cruz ever could.
2016-04-21	Cox said Trump “has shown remarkable political skill that has energized Americans who have felt disenfranchised by a government that hasn't worked for them,”      Political skill? All he did was appeal to bigotry, fear and xenophobia. It just so happens that a larger percentage of the GOP primary voting demographic goes for that sort of thing than people had anticipated. That, and candidates who plan on winning in November generally refuse to run on a platform of bigotry for good reason. Trump will win the primary, and in doing so drive his negatives among general election voters into the dirt.
2016-04-21	Trump is correct, Cruz needs to be smacked upside the head.
2016-04-21	Republican base is far bigger than the evangelical hardliners that want their beliefs imposed via law.

2016-04-22	Yep, Trump's thuggery nauseates me. But at this point he has legitimately won.      The GOP may play this game or that game or what have you to play into their Chamber of Commerce base or whatever they want to do, but frankly Trump has resoundingly won. After next week he'll have won literally the entire eastern half of the country bar a couple of home states.      Then he'll finish off the West Coast, or at least Cali, and Kasich will have won Ohio and Cruz Texas and the cattle Plains.      It's over. It's just. Over. Suck it up.
2016-04-22	I'll take our chances through a contested convention. We don't nominate people based on populism, we nominate them based on electability. Trump's ONLY chance is to stitch up 1237 before Cleveland, otherwise, baby go bye bye.
2016-04-22	No, he hasn't "legitimately" won anything yet. Delegates are there for a reason. This is NOT a win by "popular" vote. Get a clue about how primaries are run.
2016-04-22	He hasn't resoundingly won until he hits that 1237. Those are the rules. You suck that up. Whether you like the rules or not. If he makes that number before the convention then he has a lock. But if he doesn't and the delegates are unbound after the first ballot you can bet they will not vote for Trump on succeeding ballots. Then he can just suck that up. Either way, he cannot win the general election with that 70% unfavorability rating dogging him.
2016-04-22	Gee maybe if Steve House and Colorado GOP had not engaged in such an obvious and deliberate manner to deny delegates who supported Trump, people wouldn't be so angry. You can say Trump is whining, or that is how the game is played but in the end it doesn't matter to the Republican voters who see that you denied them a say in the primary. They have a right to be
2016-04-22	Yeah I have seen a few youtube postings from Trump supporters who are outraged particularly in Colorado. The party abolished the primary process and doesn't even have anything like a remotely democratic caucus proccess either. They're understandably mad, but death threats to delegates is crossing the line. If the party stitches it up for Taliban boy they can punish the party by writing in Trumps name on the ballot and vote dem in down ballot elections. That will hit them where it really hurrts.
2016-04-22	Well yeah, those are the rules. A lot of states don't have primaries or caucuses. I notice Trump only whines about it when he loses, but not when those same rules favor him. You people forget that even in the primaries it has never been a "one person, one vote" system. You vote and the delegates vote for the nominees, the voters don't. Ever hear of the Electoral College? Same deal.

2016-04-22	That's weird, from the title of the article you would think that most Democrats want Bernie to drop out, yet the graph shows 50% of Demcrats want Sanders to continue to fight for the nomination. What a way to frame the narrative..
2016-04-22	Hugh Johnson You are an idiot. Can you not add 11% and 39% that makes 50% for him to stay to at least the last primary or convention. Are you sure you're a democrat? Because your brain functions like a republican can't even do simple math
2016-04-22	fight for the nominatio? He have 0 chance, there is not the numbers. Wake up.
2016-04-22	Justin Garcia he dont have the numbers. What you going to do create delegates.? Is over for Bernie move on.
2016-04-22	What horse$hit. Popular vote doesn't even play into the naritive unless you want to cloud the issue

2016-04-22	New York Women for Bernie Sanders shared --   Chin up! Phone bank. Donate. Share. Bernie is only 230 delegates behind, and his numbers look awesome in upcoming states. Voter   suppression and MSM lies kept us from winning NY but we are still going strong.      2008 NY primary ... Hillary Clinton 1,068,496 ... 57.4% ... 139 Delegates ... Barack Obama 751,019 ... 40.3% ... 93 Delegates.      2016 NY primary ... Hillary Clinton 1,036,196 ... 57% ... 135 Delegates ... Sanders 752,202 ... 42.1% ... 104 Delegates.      There are now 1600 delegates in the next 2016 Presidential primaries.
2016-04-22	There is a path to nomination - through emailgate.
2016-04-22	Hate to disappoint you tea party a holes OOPS! I meant Bernie Supporters. Asked and answered THERE IS NO EMAIL GATE!!!!! MORON!!
2016-04-22	David Shelly so just straight up denial now? I mean you realize in the age of google you just seem crazy. We can all watch the videos of her lying about her emails. Bernie may be nice enough to let it slide, the republicans will BBQ her over them.
2016-04-22	David Shelly Exactly...........they are hard to tell apart.
2016-04-22	The Democratic Party is dead to me if they're going to nominate that lying witch. I'm moving on regardless of what Sanders might do.
2016-04-22	Enjoy Trump you will be a perfect fit for the Repudican party. We will be celebrate in November.
2016-04-22	Don't let the door hit you in the azz. You where never a dem any way, just a want a be.
2016-04-22	Hugh Johnson - You Clinton voters want us to elect your Queen in November. If you don't care what we have to say we have no interest in what you have to say. Count a lot of us out in November and enjoy President Trump.
2016-04-22	Sorry Drumpf......I don't think the rural Singlewide livin GOP dimwitted voters can stomach another round of Laser-Like-Focus on jobs much more.      Besides, If you really want to view firsthand the bullshit Drumpf is selling down river, checkout the latest episode of Real Sports on HBO. The people of Scottland were sold the same BS Drumpf is selling today. In the beginning, everyone was behind Drumpf but in the end, they wouldn't allow Drumpf to be a dog catcher..

2016-04-22	Then you need to drop out of the race. There won't be unification with the Rumpasaurus running amok.
2016-04-22	Wayne Maynard, I agree with Trump that repugs should unite.   They should all hold hands and jump off a cliff.
2016-04-22	Terry Underwood works for me!
2016-04-22	The GOP IS united ... #NeverTrump   The Trump University trail in May will show that he views everyone else as a bunch of suckers to be ripped uff at every opportunity.   Hey Trump ... when are you going to show us your income tax statments ... hiding something?
2016-04-22	But they aren't- The coalition between the 1% and the blue collar "family values voters" is done. Neither can win without the other. You get an alternative to Trump, Trump voters stay home or write in. You get Trump on the ticket, #NeverTrump people stay home, vote for Clinton, or write someone else in. Either way, the truth about this unholy matrimony has been permanantly exposed and unless the GOP changes drastically, it is going to be a while until they can win a national election.
2016-04-22	Stephanie: From another perpective, I am going to arrive to the same conclusion as you. Everybody is arriving to that conclusion. See posts below.
2016-04-22	About 10 years ago, an Australian author wrote a very incisive, thoughtful article about the GOP. He predicted:      "Immigration will be the stake through the Republican Party's heart"      At the time, I thought he was exaggerating:      http://www.dealey-plaza.org/~ramon/politics/GOP-Stake.gif      http://www.dealey-plaza.org/~ramon/politics/Guns-R-Us.gif
2016-04-22	Some Wise Poster wrote:      "This is a dream come true for the democrats. The GOP keeps courting a base that they already own while pissing off everybody else. They keep hosing down the garage while the house burns down."
2016-04-22	The dems better not just start slow and escalate slowly. You saw what that approach did for Jeb. You need an A-bomb that will stop the whole country and every conversation will be about Trump. Otherwise the dems will lose. Hillary is a very weak unattractive candidate.
2016-04-22	Newsflash, that "very weak unattractive candidate" is whipping trump in current polling and will do so quite credibly in November.
2016-04-22	Hahaha. Hillary kicks Trumps ass in every fking poll ever taken, but thanks for the heads up.
2016-04-22	Hillary is a Beacon of Light and a Goddess of Reason next to Trump & Trumper.   (And I say that as someone who generally doesn't like the Clintons, esp. Bill).
2016-04-22	Bill O'Reilly issued a warning to Donald Trump and his supporters on Thursday night, musing that the likely Republican nominee "will not, will not get a fair shake from the press" in a general election against Hillary Clinton."      Shorter version....WAAHHHHHH! Let the whining begin. Trump better put on his big boy panties, he's in for a rough ride.
2016-04-22	It's interesting that not only do you admit that the press isn't fair and impartial, but you take a certain pride in it.
2016-04-22	I think generally Americans are sick of the whining from people like Donnie who have no idea what real people think and feel. What's his name is another example...they cry because they are no longer top of the heep as old, white guys and so they whine and say it's all so unfair. Who cares?
2016-04-22	No matter what the tea party thinks..................America hates divisive, bigots, racists and misogyinsts..............so yeah.............Trump is going to get shredded in the press. On the other hand FOX News is misogynistic, racist and bigoted, as are their viewers, so of course they will end up supporting Trump.
2016-04-22	When did the Republicans become the party of victimhood? "In my day" the Republicans seemed to be the adults in the room. Now its just whaaa whaaa whaaa......
2016-04-22	They were NEVER the adults in the room. They were only the arrogant crooks who TOLD EVERYONE they were the adults in the room. Their policies have FAILED SPECTACULARLY over the past 40 years since the country started lowering taxes and catering to corporations and the Clintons have only muddied the water between Democrats and Republicans by moving SO far to the right, they now represent what was once a moderate Republican platform.
2016-04-22	Donald Trump, 45th president of the United States.
2016-04-22	Don't bet the farm...
2016-04-22	When he loses will you leave please?
2016-04-22	CJ Finney, you make a strong argument.
2016-04-22	Yes it is the Donald Trump and Mini Trump/Ted Cruz show. They walk like ducks, they talk like ducks and they act like ducks. The only difference is they hate each oither with a passion. The only thing worse they hate more is people different from who they are. . Move over Abbot and Costello, Laural and Hardy, Dean and Jerry the 3 stooges minus one. Let the show continue.
2016-04-22	you are so uneducated, Neel
2016-04-22	Hey son in order for you to insult me I would have to value your opinion.
2016-04-22	I agree with that Hilary walks the talk . deceives the deceitful.leaves americans to die And then lied to the rest of americans. A tru democratic career crooked duck
2016-04-22	The American public better thank their luck stars Obama was elected Prez twice...No doubt, Crash McCain and or Mittens would have already started WWIII and bombed Antarctica.
2016-04-22	you sound scared, son
2016-04-22	Son. People like you are the reason why we have a middle finger.
2016-04-22	Neal Levine      Roy is a jerk. No doubt about that.
2016-04-22	Enough Americans are also concerned that neither of those nutjobs will be elected. Let the Fox-poisoned tea party drones have their moment at the polls. There are enough sane voters left to make sure the world never suffers from the right's derangement syndrome. Within ten years, this taint will have succumbed to age or reason and America can move forward again.. We've already paid the price for allowing so-called conservatives to gain enough power to disrupt the country on behalf of the bigoted and the kleptocracy.
2016-04-22	They are so used to the Muslim President Obama and getting what they want any President that doesn't play nice they will be concerned about. Maybe a President that actually does what he says will scare a lot of countries.
2016-04-22	If you have children from 18-34, make sure they are registered for the draft. (It's the law). Trump or Cruz will need a draft for their World War III actions.
2016-04-22	Richard Hughes the "draft" is unconstitutional and your WWIII comment is crap
2016-04-22	Bagger nation speaks.
2016-04-22	"NATO countries, Japan and South Korea."      Politico, please change your style guide to include the oxford comma, the above is a beautiful example of why it is necessary.
2016-04-22	Or learn the power of a semicolon.
2016-04-22	I never heard of the Oxford comma, so I had to look it up:   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (pardon my tildes)   The Oxford (or serial) comma is the final comma in a list of things. For example:   Please bring me a pencil, eraser, and notebook.      The Oxford comma comes right after eraser.      Use of the Oxford comma is stylistic, meaning that some style guides demand its use while others don’t. AP Style—the style guide that newspaper reporters adhere to—does not require the use of the Oxford comma. The sentence above written in AP style would look like this:      Please bring me a pencil, eraser and notebook....See More
2016-04-22	BTW, I'm pro-Oxford comma.   Only a commie would omit the comma
2016-04-22	But why would she wanna run with Trump?
2016-04-22	Simon, she won't run with Trump. Nothing more than Bill O"Reilly bloviating.
2016-04-22	Chris Lee No one wants to be on a losing ticket. The governor is smarter than that.
2016-04-22	Chris Lee And the vicepresidents only official power is to be a tiebreaker in the senate. The rest comes down to the relationship between the VP and the president, so you have to really trust your running mate. Since she doesn't trust him and he probably doesn't wanna listen to her, there really is nothing in it for her.   And that is only in the very unlikely scenario that they win. What is more likely is that she joins a losing team, hurting her own chances in the future.
2016-04-22	Ollie North? Allen West? Dick Cheney? Ted Nugent? So many losers so little time.
2016-04-22	Wonder if Ted Nugent is still carrying around that load in his pants that he used to squirm out of the military draft when he was classified by the Selective Service Systm as "Physically, mentally and morally unfit to serve?"
2016-04-22	John Williams Spend a lot of time wondering about feces, do you?
2016-04-22	Trump wouldn't take a loser, considering he is the future president.
2016-04-22	She doesn't even like trump. Lol
2016-04-22	That in itself is not a big deal. Cheney didn't like Bush, Johnson didn't like Kennedy. Martinez just doesn't fit the bill but then neither does the Rumpasaurus.
2016-04-22	Wayne Maynard Cheney liked Bush. Bush left day to day business to him, making Cheney the most powerful VP we have had yet.
2016-04-22	Simon Holmbjerg Kristiansen and a complete bafoon
2016-04-22	Condelessa Rice !
2016-04-22	That is who I have been thinking about. Condi Rice is very smart, tough and has a lot of inside knowledge on how Washingtoon works. She would make a great VP and if something should happen to the President she would have no problem stepping up to do the job.
2016-04-22	John Smith Yes, she did quite a "job" apologizing for George W. Bush's war of genocide in Iraq! Amnesia?
2016-04-22	Isnt she part of the establishment that Trump supporters whine about all the time?
2016-04-22	"Just having some piiiiizzza"
2016-04-22	Still blaming Bush for the Obummers failures?
2016-04-22	John Smith Still elated that Bush created Al Qaeda in Iraq which has grown into ISIS after he turned the Islamic Shiite country of Iraq over to America's nemesis, Islamic Shiite Iran?   You know, the country that he called an Axis of Evil. Amnesia?
2016-04-22	John Williams Johnny, you are a very, very silly lad.

2016-04-22	Wow. Cruz is as vile as Trump. Scarey.
2016-04-22	Lyin' Ted at it again.
2016-04-22	And here's a joke for you Ted... no matter if you are right or not, he's still kicking your behind!! LOLOLO
2016-04-22	So, in two interviews from yesterday and today he has said grown men should be allowed to use bathrooms with little girls, that the "wealthy" should be taxed more, that illegals shold be let right back in and given Amnesty after they leave, the GOP platform on Abortion should be changed and he will not focus on the debt?!!! What is wrong with you Trumpsters?!!! This guy is a liberal!!! He's been lying to your face for 8 months! Wake Up!!! We must stop this guy now!!!
2016-04-22	Because only a small percentage care about the liberal vs conservative argument, it's gotten us no where. It's 2016 time for common sense.
2016-04-22	Derek Claxton That's the only question that matters Derek. They are 2 ideologically opposed world views and each lead us down a very different path. You have to make a choice what kind of country you want to be....By the way, how is re-defining biological gender common sense? How is saying the right to life of a baby in the womb is guaranteed unless it was fathered by a rapist common sense? How is deporting 20 million illegals from the country because they broke the law and then lettimg them right back in breaking another law common sense? How is stating that taxes and regulation hurt economic growth while saying unless your rich, common sense? If you want common sense, Trump is def. not the answer bro.
2016-04-22	Ted your own words to Gov. Kasich no path to the nomination remember your words you need to DROPOUT?? Heed your own words to others DROPOUT NOW!
2016-04-22	Trump = nuts   Cruz = evil      some choice for the party of Eisenhower & Lincoln

2016-04-22	Think I'll go whip up a nice fat avocado salad! Hard to beat.
2016-04-22	Avocado comes from the ancient Aztec word "ahuácatl," meaning testicle, so I can understand why Cruz would feel uncomfortable around them.
2016-04-22	Meaning he probably has a few that he keeps well hidden.
2016-04-22	Cruz doesn't like avocados well BRAVO FOXTROT DELTA. i don't like the greasy things either.
2016-04-22	Then why would you like Ted Cruz?
2016-04-22	That ad is just snarky. Who cares if someone doesn't like avocados?
2016-04-22	Run to your safe spaces libs. You just heard from real American

2016-04-22	What an idiot this general is, how in the world did he ever advance?? Loving to kill!!! That is pure psycho !!
2016-04-22	You never served. The end.

2016-04-22	Go back to your safe space lib. That's what we pay the military to do
2016-04-22	Crazy talk for a crazy election year - but certainly no crazier than Trump himself.
2016-04-22	This poor guy probably never thought he'd be dragged into the political muck. Hope he's smart enough not to be conned into running.
2016-04-22	Face it, republicans, your choice is the Orange Man or the Cuban Canadian. Good luck!
2016-04-22	I don't think Oompa Loompas are natural born American citizens. Both of the two top Republican candidates might be ineligible to serve as President.      Now, regarding General Mattis. This is strictly a Washington Beltway story. Anybody outside of the Beltway will be asking themselves: General Mattis? Oh I did not know that Johnny Mathis had children. The man is not known to run a successful independent run. Wecome President Hillary Clinton.
2016-04-22	I agree with the govenor. Why should a person lose their voting rights just because they were convicted of a felony? Unless they were convicted of a violent felony, why should they lose their right to own a gun? I had a secretary who ran a stop sign she did not see in a blinding rain storm, hit another car, and killed the driver. She got five years, serve three, for manslaughter (a felony) and could not vote or own a gun. This makes little sense to me.
2016-04-22	Hard to argue with. If you've done your time, you've served your sentence, there's no sense in making the punishment never-ending. It's already tough enough for anyone coming out of prison to re-integrate into society without pointlessly and vindictively isolating them any further.
2016-04-22	Once again the Democrats side with the criminal element, they know they cannot win elections without criminal activity.
2016-04-22	Did you take this comment from Teddy Boy Cruz?
2016-04-22	Wa
2016-04-22	Surely all RNC members are aware of the record high national unfavorability poll   numbers of The Vile Trumpet Con-Man. If their nominee, he will destroy the party   for years to come.
2016-04-22	Yes, it will be destroyed if he is the nominee and will be destroyed if he is not the nominee. Either way the Dems win.
2016-04-22	Jane Piasecki Blackwell Smell ?   Someone who says he would like to punch a protester in the face ... that smells.   Someone who disrespects POWs ... that smells   Someone who wants to ban all Muslims from entering the country ... that smells.      37% of the GOP voters stepped into poop ... and now want to track it all over the party?   ... I don't think so.
2016-04-22	Thanks Ron, I didn't think there was ANYTHING good about rump getting the nod. You proved me wrong.
2016-04-22	The Donald/anti-Donald primary is like one of those sleazy reality shows. You hate that you watch but you have to see what idiotic and unbelievable thing happens next.
2016-04-22	The entire GOP primary season has been an eight month long Jerry Springer show.

2016-04-22	lol it's the best
2016-04-22	never mind that Trump has 2.3M+ more votes than Cruz
2016-04-22	This race has been all about Trump for a long time. Trump is the major issue in the republican primary and a majority of republicans have rejected him. He gets a similar percentage of the vote as Bernie Sanders, the only difference is that Trump's opponents are divided.
2016-04-22	I didn't know there were that many illiterates in the country. What did I know?
2016-04-22	Daniel Warren Curtis in NY Bernie got 752,000 votes and Drumpf only got 518,000. He is not even close to Bernie! #NeverTrump
2016-04-22	Never Trump. I will not vote for Trump if he were the republican nominee. I will write in someone else's name or vote third party.
2016-04-22	Zodi Yabadoo Lordy, I don't blame him.
2016-04-22	THIS is what it must have been like in 1932 in Germany----just before Hitler came to power in that election
2016-04-22	Zodi Yabadoo Voting or trump is voting for nothing. Emplty suit.
2016-04-22	Trump has won almost every state where the people outnumber the cows...      How exactly are they going to ignore that?
2016-04-22	I guess the same way they ignore the Constitution.
2016-04-22	But, it is a split field. Many Republicans will never vote for him, including myelf.   So 40-60% of Republicans will sit home or vote for HIllary ( I will vote for Hillary, a person who stole furniture from the WH and had to return it) then vote for a racist like Trump.
2016-04-22	500,000 less then Hillary in HIS home state. Ignore that all you want.
2016-04-22	It's curious that Sanders is behind (albeit slightly) because Indiana seems like it's more demographically suited for him. It's very white (similar in demographics to Wisconsin and Minnesota) and has a lot of younger individuals.      I'm not saying that the poll is off, it seems to fly in the face of demographics, and in the past election cycle, it seems that demography is destiny.
2016-04-22	Indiana is most like Ohio where Clinton won handily.
2016-04-22	As a Hoosier for well over a half century, Indiana in 2016 seems much like the Mountain West states Bernie grabbed, because in Indiana if you're white, there's a BIG chance you're a Republican. Those left over are likely to be serious liberals. The difference with the western states is that Indiana has a sizable African American population which will probably tilt heavily toward Hillary. The key will be how many millennials- Bernie backers for sure based on the bumper stickers on their Subarus, have actually registered and are ready to vote.
2016-04-22	Your right as to independents and new voters, but if it were just the core Democrat voters. The poll noted that if there was a record turnout that would benefit Sanders. It said that most of the voters strong with Sanders don't vote very often as compared to the core Democrats who do vote and those are the ones strong for Clinton.
2016-04-22	I like Politico never prints information about how the polls show Sanders beats Trump and Cruz by double digits but Clinton ties or loses to both.
2016-04-22	Because the site is called Politico. And anyone with any poltical sense knows that hypothetical GE polls 7 months out are completely meaningless. Just ask Presidents Dukakis, Mondale, and Romney.      I love how Berner's think he should get the nomination handed to him based on polls of 500 potential voters, rather than the results of actual voting.
2016-04-22	Greg Gundling You mean the results of voting where only Democrats are allowed to vote?      In what way does Clinton winning the Dem Primary correlate to her winning the General Election?      IN the General election..independents and Republicans are allowed to vote. Sanders has a FAR greater chance of winning than Clinton does. Clinton is the most hated woman in AMerica.
2016-04-22	Adam Sinclair No as in national polls this early really do mean zero. Currently Sanders has had almost no attack ads against him, but the Rove has been leading that by just attacking Clinton and supporting Sanders.   So national means nothing.   This part from the poll should be noted and it depends on turnout. This is from the polling company.      Among core Democratic voters, Clinton has a 53-40% lead over Sanders. Among occasional voters, that flips to 55-40% for Sanders and among first time voters, Sanders has a huge 66-27% lead. In order for Sanders to win Indiana, “There would have to be more than record turnout.”
2016-04-22	Stop trying to keep Cruz relevant. He's not.
2016-04-22	He never was...but he is one scary man!
2016-04-22	Susan Burke   It's that snarling with his teeth bared thing...      It sure made me want to vote foranybody else.
2016-04-22	Go, Bernie!!! Hillary is NOT for us, she is for herself!!!
2016-04-22	Bernie is not for us he is for white liberals
2016-04-22	Jeromi Wiggins      Is that why he has been fighting for equal rights for his entire life?
2016-04-22	Jeromi Wiggins Bernie is for all iberals and the people.
2016-04-22	Kasich needs to drop out. It is actually the most rational way to get to a contested convention and therefore his best chance to actually get nominated. That is, unless Kasich's goal has been to get Trump elected this whole time.
2016-04-22	No, if he drops out Trump would probably pickup his votes as most Kasich voters aren't dumb enough to vote for Cruz.      And this is coming from someone who hates Trump
2016-04-22	David Romer I doubt it. This entire primary has been about Trump. My guess is that Kasich supporters will either switch to Cruz or not vote at all. Kasich dropping out will also make a big difference in Indiana where Cruz and Trump are close. Even if Trump picks up a few voters, Cruz would pick up more.
2016-04-22	Daniel Warren Curtis I really don't see Kasich voters going for Cruz he is actually worse then Trump and that is saying a lot.   Plus you should consider this Cruz is the one who doing terrible right now. The only place where he is winning is the smoked filled rooms while Kasich has been outpolling him as of late.   So Cruz comes across as being slimey and not to be trusted and I have noticed that what Trump has been saying about him is hitting home.
2016-04-22	The pandering by Crooked Hillary is disgusting.      Crooked Hillary's indictment will come six months from now just in time to bow out for "health" reasons. Just in time for the October Suprise. That is the only reason Bernie is sticking around.   The liberal party of hate, Feminist white guilt has shamed the people of this country into hating white men.   Would you place her before:   Dwight D. Eisenhower   Nikola Tesla   Dr. Jonas Salk   Albert Einstein   Thomas Edison...See More

2016-04-22	Chuck Naugle - What took place in Chicago cannot continue, please share this video with everyone you know.      @ 29:31 Dr. Chamberlin stated she observed an auditor erase 21 Bernie Sanders votes and add 49 Hillary Clinton votes so the votes would match the Board of Election numbers.      @1:12:42 Mr. William Shipman with the NY Ballot Integrity Project, and he is an Attorney out of NY living in Chicago he clearly saw things that should not have taken place.      Someone stole this election from Bernie in Chicago, and this cannot continue.      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSNTauWPkTc

2016-04-22	Actually what they are reporting on is that Hills says it isn't enough. If you could read you'd undertsand that this article is about fair pay for women. Lift your arms a bit so your knuckles aren't dragging . . . . .
2016-04-22	Dan Zettel prove woman are paid less......I will wait
2016-04-22	Dan Zettel exactly, dipshit, that's precisely what my post is making fun of. She says it's not enough. Everyone knows this and it isn't worth reporting on.
2016-04-22	Pedophile Clown says "women are bitches." Not surprising that Trump is wrong about this....
2016-04-22	you sound mad
2016-04-22	Roy Ellis I couldn't be happier that Pedophile Clown is going to be the Retardican nominee.
2016-04-22	Dan Zettel trumps NOT a pedophile, but Hillary IS a serial liar, son
2016-04-22	Maybe they should put a picture of all the women her husband either raped or had affairs with. The Treasury would have to come up with a slew of new denomintions to fit them all.

2016-04-22	Any guesses on the death toll and body count from the 2016 Republican National Convention?
2016-04-22	If delegates and elected officials feel unsafe, they should make sure that security hands out free handguns to everyone as they enter the convention hall. That will make them feel safer about having their children in attendance. As people leave, they can turn in the handguns.
2016-04-22	Behind the scenes, the Secret Service is calling their master plan for security at the republican convention "Operation Duck and Cover", and they're floating the idea of purtting little bells around the necks of all the Trump supporters so they know where they are at all times.
2016-04-22	Your comment reminds me of a question a reporter asked a Secret Service agent at the opening of the Reagan Library years ago when all the Presidents were there (Nixon, Ford, Carter, Bush and of course Reagan). He asked "Is it true that if someone shoots President Bush, one of you is supposed to shoot Dan Quayle?" The agent just smiled and didn't answer...
2016-04-22	How many fist fights will happen on convention floor? "Let's get ready to rumble". Too bad Bernie supporters won't get to play. They seem to want a good fight.
2016-04-22	Yes, American is watching...and laughing.
2016-04-22	Yes they are watching and shaking their heads thinking they really did this to themselves. I will have my popcorn watching.
2016-04-22	If they really want to raise money they should put the convention on pay per view. I have to admit I would order it.
2016-04-22	Sarah Harper : I wouldn't waste a penny to listen to all the hyperbole, lies and bullc#hit they would spout.
2016-04-22	So, you are saying America is watching the primary, therefore, unifying the party at a contested convention will be the perfect way of getting general election voters?
2016-04-22	Rancid Penis is the main GOP con, so, he is immune to the irony of his statements.
2016-04-22	Actually, the whole world is watching and shaking their heads at this silly crap!
2016-04-22	Never dreamed we had such rotten leadership. If they put in an establishment candidate, I hope Trump starts his own party and that he wins against the other rotten wanna bees.
2016-04-22	Not in a million years will I unite behnd the NYC Billionaire champion of the common red state man. Scorched earth.
2016-04-22	thats ok we dont need you
2016-04-22	Doyle Bodenhamer , Well said.
2016-04-22	Then, please just don't vote at all. We sure as hell don't need oblamer 3.0 with the hildabeast or barney as the next potus!
2016-04-22	"America is watching" is the terrifying thought that keeps Reince Freebush flopping about in nasty puddles of flop-sweat in the wee hours every night. He can't stop thinking about the growing probability that the republican party is going to implode on his watch, and there's not a damn thing he can do about it.
2016-04-22	I would hold my nose to vote for Cruz, but never Trump. Good luck Cruz, you'll need it!
2016-04-22	Cruz believes that a women cannot get an abortion if she is raped, He will raise taxes and he wants to de-fund all of planned parenthood even the part that does cervical cancer screening for young girls who can't afford it. Wake up He is tooooooooooooo conservative for 2016
2016-04-22	Joyce Black Luckily for the pro-choice crowd, the president doesn't have the authority to decide abortion law. Even if Cruz were elected president he could not overturn Roe v Wade. As for Planned Parenthood, everyone would be fine funding it if it stopped performing abortions. The fact of the matter is that it is a controversial organization because it is the largest provider of abortion, not the cervical screenings. Why not channel government funding to organizations that provide cancer screenings but aren't controversial? That way Planned Parenthood can continue to do its thing but pro-life voters don't feel like their tax dollars are supporting the nation's largest abortion provider. Also, if abortion is really only 2% of what Planned Parenthood does, it shouldn't be that big of a deal for them to either stop providing abortions and then everyone would be ok funding them and they wouldn't need to spend so much of their money donating to political campaigns and on PACs.
2016-04-22	Daniel in Utah - You had your chance. Cruz will not be on the ballot again!   Trump has Millions of more votes than any other candidate.   Trump will Make America Great Again.... get on board the Trump Train!   #neverLyinTed
2016-04-22	It is clear that Cruz's superior brain power extends to arithmetic. Cruz would LOSE BIG in the November General election - by his slapping the crap out of everybody who tries to listen to him riff 'Harvard-ian' for more than a few minutes - with that big, fat rolled-up copy of the U.S. Constitution in his hand, and with The Bible in the other.

2016-04-22	I am waiting for a candidate who will promise to balance the budget, reduce taxes, pay down the debt, bring jobs back to the US, stand up to the liberal Democrats, destroy ISIS, support Israel, make us energy independent, stop global warming, eliminate the depts of Education and the IRS, fix Obamacare and Medicare and the SS Trust Fund, get rid of harmful regulations, protect our borders, build a wall, send criminals back to their home country and solve many more of our problems.      Any takers?
2016-04-22	You're basically asking for the impossible and half of that wouldn't even help us lol.
2016-04-22	max-- Obama has come closer than any conservative, despite your GOP efforts to stop him
2016-04-22	The much maligned IRS is the absolute most effective tax collection agency the planet has seen. For every 100.00 in revenue it collects it only spends 0.39 to do so. There is absolutely NO possible way to abolish this agency and then collect enough revenue for the US government to function.      That is ONE of the many problems with Cruz. His ideas that pivitol departments within the government can be simply eliminated without collapsing the US and Global economy is INFANTILE. Equally asinine is going back to the gold standard as a guarantuer of our currency. There are VERY good reasons no recognized state on the entire PLANET uses it. In fact the only organization (not actually a nation) that does so just so happens to be equally religiously fanatical, ISIS.
2016-04-22	Cruz is a desperate man, hoping there will be "a miracle" just like he was told. He probaby sobs into his hotel pillow every night asking,"why?"
2016-04-22	Indiana you must get out and vote. Lyin Ted is not who we want in the White house Vote TRUMP

2016-04-22	The only way Bubba Trump can restore any credibility on foreign policy is to unequivocally repudiate/repudiate again every one of his major foreign policy proclamations of the last six months, including (1) the intentional bombing of women and children, (2) using torture, (3) giving American nukes to Saudi Arabia, (the most dangerous state sponsor of Islamic terrorism on Planet Earth), (4) insulting NATO, (5) complimenting Putin's "leadership" when confronted with a question about the invasion of Crimea and the killing of journalists in Russia, (6) proposing sending 30,000 U.S. troops to Syria (and then pretending he didn't), (7) saying the Iranian nuclear deal requires America to defend Iran if it's attacked by Israel, and (8) calling the Chinese "mother#uckers" in a rant about import tariffs.      The man is a howling buffoon who's almost as ignorant and uneducated about foreign policy as Caribou Barbie, and who's come WAY too far down The Road to Stupid to turn back now.
2016-04-22	Your point is based in logic, reason, and and a knowledge of the adverse affects that Trump's policies would produce. Unfortunately, most people who support him don't care about these things. They see his charismatic speeches and his ability to simplify everything to "we'll make it better" and they eat it up, becuase it's easy and because it's fun. I'm confident that there are enough people sensible people in America that Trump will get demolished in the general election. If not, we deserve everything that comes after.

2016-04-22	Lol yea just wait till people who wont vote for her come nov.. ....Trump will crush her ...

2016-04-22	Women don't like her, yet she has grabbed women's votes in this primary 60/40 over her opponent.      Can't imagine what that number would be like with Trump.....70/30?

2016-04-22	They're both terrible, what King is saying is that if he has to choose one it will partial be Trump. Most of the time Trump will be joking and Cruz is always dead serious, do you want someone that says stupid things or someone that's really stupid?   To think these are the best that the GOP has says how desperate they really are, out of a field of 17 and we have to choose between DUMB AND DUMBER?
2016-04-22	So they turn from Ted Cruz Mini Trump and want Donald. Yes Donald Trump the racist, the bigot, the anti-Semite. Yes the GOP will go with Trump and become known as the party of hate.
2016-04-22	I knew he was doomed when he let Rump take the evangelical South from him. That was to be his stronghold and he didn't even pull one Southern state.
2016-04-22	I don't see how people can vote for Cruz either. He just seems so fake to me.
2016-04-22	Agreed Lynn. Example: Was Cruz a religious polician before the presidential primary? I don't recall that.
2016-04-22	Mussolini didn't kill as many people as Hitler.....that didn't make him a great leader.

2016-04-22	King is spot-on about Crybaby Cruz   .. he's a phony and not to be trusted!!! I personally believe he's sneaky and jealous of Trumps success too!!! Cruz acts like that one kid everyone hated in their childhood: tattles, antagonizes others, etc. He lies about what Trump says, he unfairly critisizes, he uses reverse-psychology and sarcastic remarks to downplay Trumps triumphs and then disingenuously exaggerates his own shortcomings as fantastic personal characteristics!!! He's just one of those people you hate to see coming ... better to cross the street!!!
2016-04-22	His history has shown that he has never been able to work with or get along with others. Starting with his college roommate and going on from there. No matter what jobs he's had. He's a repellent individual and a theocratic religious nut. I wouldn't vote for him to be dog catcher.

Take a look at the Cruz site and see what a true leader looks like!
2016-04-22	Mr King works in the House of Representatives. That's what the "Rep" in front of his name means.
2016-04-22	FYI: King isn't in the Senate, but those who DO work in the Senate with Cruz all seem to despise him.
2016-04-22	Ann Roberts: I strongly disagree with you in regards to Mr. Cruz. While I am not a huge fan of Mr. King, or Mr. Trump for that matter - those feelings are irrelevant - I still respect them. How do you come up with "IQ of 80"? "Fools haven't done a thing for the people"? You give an impression of a very nasty person, Mrs. Roberts.

If Trumps Bathroom statement did not wake people up and show him for who he truly is, it is not possible to wake people up. They are dead in their sensibilities......   Steve Deace   ·   The reason you get the same gubment no matter who wins is because the battle isn't between Democrats and Republicans. The enemy is progressivism in both parties.   This is why I oppose all progressives, Democrat or Republican, primary and general, at all times with no situational exception.   The biggest self-inflicted political scam in history is voting for a Republican progressive to beat a Democrat progressive. All it did was help the Left take the country where they've wanted to go since McGovern a little slower. But we lost nonetheless, and everything we attempted to accomplish in the meantime has been wiped out.

2016-04-22	Specifically what is making you lean toward him? Serious question .
2016-04-22	Leaning towards the wrong guy..... he is nothing but a New York Socialist Liberal.....   Steve Deace   1 hr ·   The reason you get the same gubment no matter who wins is because the battle isn't between Democrats and Republicans. The enemy is progressivism in both parties.   This is why I oppose all progressives, Democrat or Republican, primary and general, at all times with no situational exception.   The biggest self-inflicted political scam in history is voting for a Republican progressive to beat a Democrat progressive. All it did was help the Left take the country where they've wanted to go since McGovern a little slower. But we lost nonetheless, and everything we attempted to accomplish in the meantime has been wiped out.
2016-04-22	Monica Walker Mimier, name me one economic conservative that has served in the white house since McGovern? Hell, make that Hoover!
2016-04-22	Cruz is too conservative for California. And California abhors a phony, notwistanding the inexplicable rise of Gray Davis.
2016-04-22	Well other then Wisc and that was a protest vote against Trump Cruz really hasn't done all that well in primaries. You know the ones where people vote. Cruz is the slime king of smoke filled rooms.   On top of that Cruz is feeling some chest pains in IN where he thought he had it all sewed up and now it's not.   Both Cruz and Trump are nuts, but I think that Cruz is a more dangerous nut.
2016-04-22	Philip E Clarkson Jr - Cruz is a lawyer...synonymous with slime.
2016-04-22	Well, seven years of Barack Obama cementing his legacy as the worst president in U.S. history, coupled with one of the worst budget shortfalls of any state, will do that for you.
2016-04-22	WOW - you are an absolute moron !!!!!
2016-04-22	I'm a little split over this. On one hand, it could help the Democratic party a lot and will help pave the way to taking back the Hill and the WH. On the other hand, the DNC has been trying to "decide" the race for years now, putting every rule, endorsement, etc. in Bernie's way to try to coronate Hillary.      Look, as a Bernie supporter I would support Hillary over Trump on most, if not all days. However, that doesn't automatically make me want to campaign for her or hop on the Democratic bandwagon just because a bunch of insiders said so. I don't think that's right. Nobody would've been talking about the issues that are facing us all on the Democratic side because Hillary would've already been set for the nomination from Day 1. I think Bernie's candidacy has increased the amount of debate in this race, whether you agree with him or not. I'm happy to see this and think it's absurd to say that it'll "destroy the party."
2016-04-22	No one knew Bernie was going to run 'for years' so it's virtually impossible that the DNC has been plotting to put rules in his way.
2016-04-22	Cheryl Onstad Since 1984, the rules have been put in place to block an insurgent.
2016-04-22	It's nice to see the optimism from Sanders supporters, but the writing is on the wall and our guy has lost the nomination. What happens next is of paramount importance. This movement, the feelings that Sanders has stirred up, well, it dies if Clinton or the DNC alone get the data. There are a multitude of organizations that have sprung up that represent the true grassroots nature of these ideas and his candidacy, and Clinton and the DNC are not members of that group. I am a lifelong Democrat and will vote for the Democrat in November, but I want a truly progressive party, whether Democrat or by some other name.      For the record, I've removed my name from the list because I won't be used as a bargaining tool and I don't want unsolicited emails, even from my own party.
2016-04-22	Politics. All it comes down to is $$$$
2016-04-22	Not in this election cycel. The secret can't be found in a big fat check book or any list. The secret is just called integrity.
2016-04-22	Sara Brightman you mean Winnery.
2016-04-22	Sara Brightman grow up. You Bernie people REFUSE to examine Bernie seriously. The FEC has charged hi campaign with millions in illegal funds. ROVE money to decimate Hillary has always been the guess...coming from "foreign sources". Only children use terms like Shillery. There is NO EVIDENCE of anything pertaining to $$$ related to her as unethical. GOP LIES SEND SMEARS for years have produced the unfair negatives on her.
2016-04-22	Greedy, money grubbing %$@*&. I like Bernie, but It'll be a cold day in hell before I ever support Clinton. I'd sooner support Trump.
2016-04-22	That is my plan. he DNC will figure it out after they have lost the White House for another 12 to 20 years. The gall of those folks, predetermining an election, using mass media paid trolls and the like. They will get what they deserve and unfortunately, we will be dragged along with them. Enough of the corrupt status quo political hacks PERIOD!
2016-04-22	Eileen Shaeffer - Between calling people 'closet Trump lovers' and your laughable attempt at chastizing Boo Taylor, I'd say you do. Are you part of Hillary's troll armada?
2016-04-22	David Flick I was just about to ask the same question.
2016-04-22	If I start getting emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign I'm gonna be pissed. She's no better than Kissinger, Nixon, the Neocons, Albright, Obama, and on and on. It saddens me that they have so many fooled into picking a "side." They all work for the same death machine.
2016-04-22	By the way where do you live?
2016-04-22	Yeah the minute that happens I'll be blocking them. But I can't see how they'd be that stupid.
2016-04-22	I started getting emails from the Clinton campaign approximately a week after her campaign came out saying that Bernie had access to the voter lists. I don't know where she got my email address as I have never been a supporter of Clinton's. It appeared that Clinton had access to the voter lists and used them. It must be the republican in her that enabled her to accuse someone of doing something she was already doing.
2016-04-22	Lol, not gonna happen unless Clinton steals the nomination (i.e. NY Purge), but I can't wait to hit "Unsubscribe" if this ever happens.
2016-04-22	You mean like Bernie tried to do when he had his staff ILLEGALLY download Hillary's voter info? Kinda like that? If Hillary had have done that, you creeps would be all over her for it.
2016-04-22	Bruce Hill Bruce...you are lying deliberately. It was an IT guy recommended by the DNC who had formerly worked on the Clinton campaign. Bernie fired him when he found out.
2016-04-22	Terry Brawley Bernie took his sweet time firing him and then used all the information for hours before notifying the DNC
2016-04-23	Trump the Chump is a loser and Clinton plant who'll be shown the door at the convention regardless of delegate count. He's the only person the Republicans could nominate who would lose to Old Lady Clinton in the general election.
2016-04-23	You probably need to do a little research before shooting off your mouth...according to a consolidation of major polls, Cruz loses to Clinton, as well...the only one who is shown to beat her (or Sanders) is Kasich.      http://www.realclearpolitics.com/.../general_election...      http://www.realclearpolitics.com/.../general_election...      http://www.realclearpolitics.com/.../general_election...

2016-04-23	We have room for:      • Pro-Life   • Pro-Choice      in the Party of T-O-L-E-R-A-N-C-E
2016-04-23	We have room for the:      - Religious   - Atheists      in the Party of Tolerance
2016-04-23	Given Trump's reputation of violence at rallies and incendiary language its predictable that this strong arm approach to campaigning would permeate down through his organization. The man is a fascist in his use of threats of violence and his policy of name calling and scapegoating minority groups. Republicans should realize by now Trump is not going to embrace a kinder and gentler persona in spite of the new charm approach. As they say, its his way or the highway that is the best they can hope if he is successful. Republicans will be kept in line as he does what he feels is best for him.
2016-04-23	The man definitely has the characteristics of a cult leader, textbook narcissistic psychopath.
2016-04-23	What will be the behavior if he wins the nomination...all of us that have made it clear that we will never vote for him can we expect our houses to be burned down, being fired or maybe shot by "well meaning" supporters?

2016-04-23	It's not that he was born abroad that is significant, he was born A Canadian Citizen. Something he has never bothered to file the required paperwork to renounce.   The ONLY provision in the Constitution for a Citizen of a Foreign Country to become POTUS required that they have been born before the Constitution was signed, there is no exclusion for dual Nationals. In fact there is evidence his mother was a Canadian Citizen who voted in Canadian Elections at the time of his birth.   This is not so cut-n-dried.
2016-04-23	he IS a "natural born U S Citizen"......deal with it, son
2016-04-23	Roy Ellis - It figures a simple-minded fool like you doesn't understand the nuance or relevance to the situation, so please, go back to your cage!
2016-04-23	Iska Bibble the FACT is, my uneducated son, is that Ted Cruz is a "natural born U S citizen"
2016-04-23	Cruz IS a natrual born U S citzen
2016-04-23	According to what laws/ court precedent? Because despite what Cruz says, it isn't settled law and the Supreme Court has never answered the question.
2016-04-23	James Jefferson ever hear of the McCarren-Walter Act, son
2016-04-23	What is settled law is that Cruz is a US citizen. Whether he is natural born to satisfy the constitutional requirement to be president is not.
2016-04-23	His father was a good friend of Fidel Castro and conspired with Lee Harvey Oswald to assasinate President Kennedy. Great candidate. (yes, sarcasm)
2016-04-23	Bill Clinton is a serial rapist
2016-04-23	Roy Ellis Hastert molested boys and Republicans put him 2nd in line to the Presidency, while they were working on impeachign Bill.      I suggest Republicans stfu about sexual deviance until Hastert is put away.
2016-04-23	Roy Ellis What has that to do with the thread? Relationship of Kiwis to Pumpkins? About the same. Same response to Kaitlin Rush. That has what to do with this thread about Cruz?
2016-04-23	Unless his mother renounced her American citizenship before he was born, Cruz is a natural born US citizen.
2016-04-23	If she was a Canadian citizen at the time of Ted's birth, he is not a natural born US citizen.
2016-04-23	Generally the provision is that one had to take a positive act to establish citizenship elsewere, not an active renunciation (those standards were established later). If she had become a Canadian citizen (which was possible given the time frame of her husbands citizenship and her residency), then it is possible.      As well, US Citizens were required to submit to the US Consulate or Embassy a Consular Record of a Birth Abroad. That's obviously an affirmative record of a claim of US Citizenship for a child born abroad. The application is to be filed immediately so that the Consul can determine th...See More
2016-04-23	Where does the Constitutition provide for this? Winston Churchill's mother was a native (natural born) America who married a Brit. Does that make him eligible to be President if he renounced is British Citizenship? Where do you people read this in the Constitution? Where? If you say statute law, I will refer you to Article VI, paragraph 2.

2016-04-23	Yep, so the gravy train continues and the elites get to keep screwing the American people
2016-04-23	David James And you think that the elites that "get to keep screwing the American people" are liberals? Don't know where you have been.

2016-04-23	Rosario Dawson is fast-proving to be a true idiot. Dragging Lewinsky into the presidential campaign when she is not involved in any way is actual bullying by Dawson. Her desperation is palpable...hey, Rosario, Bernie lost.
2016-04-23	It's not like a Democrat Presidential candidate accused dozens of women of being "bimbos" to cover up the proven sexual advances and misconduct of her husband.

2016-04-23	Is this woman a Republican? Sounds like it. Rosario Dawson that is.
2016-04-23	Apparently, there are Dems like Rosario who are principled enough to call out Clinton bullying tactics when they present themselves. Kudos to Ms. Lewinski for her courage. And, kudos to Rosario for recognizing that courage. As for others who are in denial about the Clintons' severe personality flaws, they apparently share those same flaws.
2016-04-23	David Trott you are overly emotionally involved in your candidate and its rotting your brain.

2016-04-23	Rosario Dawson is an idiot and dbag!! No wonder why no one is giving her any roles.      Shame on her bringing Republican talking points. Soon Sanders will endorse Hillary and Dawson will become the leftover idiot.
2016-04-23	So you don't mind politicians calling women "bimbos" or victim shaming, as long as they are Democrats? So coruption and influence peddeling is ok as long as your a woman and a democrat?   http://www.usatoday.com/.../news/nation/2016/04/21/83356970/
2016-04-23	In my humble opinion, it shows a series of bad decisions of the both of them; Hilary's Iraq war vote, Bill's filandering...they don't strike me as honest, authentic people...in a contest between Clinton and Trump, what the hell does anyone gain by either?
2016-04-23	Michael Andrew Cabus You can't seriousy be asking that. Get over whatever personal flaws you perceive the Clintons have, Hillary is extremely smart, her policies are thoughtful and comprehensive, she's respected around the world and 10,000X more ready to be POTUS than Trump.
2016-04-23	I can't believe how low Bernie's campaign has gone.
2016-04-23	True! If there is ANYONE out there that even DOUBTS that the campaign didn't put her up to this then you are a fool tool
2016-04-23	oh and the Messiah started out with I have never run a negative campaign...just another narcissist who is a sore loser
2016-04-23	It's really getting to the point of desperate!

2016-04-23	Lewinsky is an anti bullying advocate as a result of having her charecter assaisinated by Hillary Clinton, and the rest of the democratic establishment. But I guess victim blaming is ok as long as the accused is a Democrat.
2016-04-23	Shaun Zaarrae Monica assasinated her own Character by flashing her thong and then telling everyone she could to elevate her status that she had an affair with the President..
2016-04-23	Shaun Zaarrae There was no reason to bring up Lewinsky by name and you know it. She did it as a anti-Clinton dogwhistle.

2016-04-23	It's not bibles idiot! It's called common sense! Many Liberal panzies like yourself and Politico are praying and hoping that the Republican party nominates Donald "Small Hands" Trump so Shillary can destroy him in November and set the party decades back as a permanent minority party. 62% of Republican voters have voted against Donald "Whiner" Trump and many of us will vote against him in November if the party is stupid enough to nominate this modern day version of Hitler.
2016-04-23	Rodrigo - 8o% have voted against Cruz so I really don't understand your logic. But don't worry, Trump will crush Hillary. His numbers this week have already started moving up against her and he hasn't even started attacking her yet.

Andrew Jackson would have Uncle Ben barefoot and naked chained to a tree. But Uncle Ben is proud to be a slave in the GOP plantation.      While his friends , Trump and LePage - laugh at him.
2016-04-24	Where was a racist statement made in this story?
2016-04-24	Victor Racioppi Certainly not a racist remark, its true, and the frustration is real. However, he is. Being an outsider, you would only get his "highlight" reel, (unless you really been following this guy for whatever reason) although the list of flaps that make national news these days, well, grow longer by the day. To give you some insight about our "beloved" Govener, he won his election by splitting the Democrat vote, I shit you not, he was actaully donating to the least popualar Democrat, in order to keep him in the race. Its a fact that, had not the LePage capaign stepped in to help Eliot Cutler, (Who had zero change of winning) he would have ran out of money long before the election.
2016-04-24	I might add, he did that both the first time he got elected, and when he got reelected. BOTH times Eliot Cutler was the one to split the vote... Trust me, many qestions have been asked, unfortuanlly, they have been largly ingored.

Textbook example of a sockpuppet account run by a paid troll from the David Brock organization. Is he still getting royalties from his slut shaming of Anita Hill? Sanders should stay in til the end, b/c it exposes more and more of Clinton's true colors.

2016-04-24	An election shouldn't be just a personality contest. Don't give up on cherished issues like infrastructure repair for employment and climate damage mitigation quite yet. Sanders and Clinton propose the same kinds of liberal social programs. He could not get them passed against Congressional domination by extreme Republican tax and budget cutters.

Sticking to your guns is all well and good, but the country must actually be governed - we've got to lessen some of the obstinate, unyielding gridlock at some point - even if it doesn't conform with someone's ideological purity.   Tip O'Neill and Reagan were on to at least something, when they compromised on some issues. Even Obama and some grudging Repub compromises are better than a hardline ZERO and f u, opposition.
2016-04-24	One difference to your theory, Robert. When Hillary wins the Presidency, the Dems will have taken back the US Senate and weakened the House currently run by the GOP, considerably.      And that's mainly due to her working and campaigning for Democrats.      Bernie would never win the US Presidency and the far Right would increase their stranglehold on Congress. It's the very reason they are terrified of her.
2016-04-24	1. Bloomberg is great.      2. Bloomberg can't be drafted. He would have come in if Sanders was the nominee. But when Sanders fell out of contention, Bloomberg made it clear that he won't run. He's done his thing with the new tower in NY, and now he's working on gun control and clean energy. That's his life's work.      3. This 'Hillary Neocon' thing is simple-minded. George McGovern, defeated hero of the anti-Viet Nam War Movement, voted for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. McGovern's reasons were complicated, as were Hillary's.      Is it asking too much to expect adults to fathom the complexities of Congressional voting? I don't see why. How can an American not understand how the American Congress works: byzantine, contradictory, non-linear, horse-trading -- much like the nation it represents.      I'm sorry, but "Hillary Voted for the War!" is for people who can't or refuse to see beyond the obvious. But isn't it obvious that in America, Congressional logic is never obvious?
2016-04-24	Sanders and trump don't have a chance. They made noise only
2016-04-24	And now Hillary has a Super PAC whose sole purpose is to scour the Internet and rewrite the truth. I wonder how they'll do if Bernie wins Penn.
2016-04-24	Still dreaming? Magic Bernie cares not if he loses NY, PA, etc. - he's got plenty o' $$$, so he can start in on the '20 or '24 primary season.
2016-04-24	actually that super pac has been around for awhile now and their only mission is to battle lies and distortions made against hillary. the while moving into the chat rooms things is a bit silly if you ask me since it doesnt really reach a large target audience. they mostly rebut claims made in ads and during television interviews
2016-04-24	If Hillary's Super PACs rewriting the Truth, What went wrong in NY? As far as I remember, Bernie Bots claimed they were leading and winning NY. Where were those 27,000 people? I tell you; when you threw a rally in WS Park - Half of them were Tourists & NYU students. It's Understandable you guys have YUUGE arithmetic problem.

Outsourcing the production of goods and the operation of administrative services such as call centers is a tremendous saving on operating costs for businesses. They are also able to get cheaper land and natural resources in countries other than the U.S. It is not as simple as Trump is making it. He talks about China devaluing it's currency. Even if thats true, what leverage do we have to make China stop devaluing it's currency? Part o...See More
2016-04-24	The only leverage we have over China is the Japan-dominated Asian Development Bank. And yet Trump bashes Japan too.

2016-04-24	He is a better man than me. The exit poll discrepencies, the hand counted audits all say something else. The Dems have guaranteed a lot more Naders in their future with the way they have told outsiders not to bother. Only an idiot would follow Sanders' path of an outsider candidate trying to play in a rigged primary.
2016-04-24	Exit polls, like all polls, suffer from poor sampling issues. They're not some sort of infallibly accurate reflection of the primary election.
2016-04-24	李淼然 No, they are more of an exact science than preference polls. In European countries if an exit poll is off by a certain amount of points it triggers an automatic investigation.      So are hand counted audits now suspect too?
2016-04-24	In any case, by running as a Democrat, Sanders gains a lot of visibility and reach that would be unavailable to independent candidates or smaller party candidates. How much press coverage does Jill Stein get? Or Gary Johnson?
2016-04-24	Maybe if Sanders had been a member of Democratic Party for the past 30 years, he would be in a better position to ctiticize. He's like a guest at a party complaining about how the party was planned and organized.
2016-04-24	Bernie - if you need a refresher course in class and grace look how Hillary behaved when she found herself in the EXACT same position as you in 2008.      Take the high road, Bernie

2016-04-24	Thats the only reason she didnt force a floor vote at the convention. Obama cut a deal with her.

When your record in backing Democratic Party members for election or reelection is spotty at best? No, not when we have the chance of a lifetime to take the White House, Senate, possibly the House! Especially with the turmoil and self destruction the Republican Party is going through right now. Quit the bitchin' and get out of the way!
2016-04-24	Hey moron...politicians serve the public...not the party.      Nobody outside of Congress gives a fuck whether or not sanders raised money for others or how long he has been in the party. If Sanders ideas arent the epitome of Democratic Party values then Im not a Democrat anymore.

Now, go back to Facebook and share those memes!
2016-04-24	Enjoy the future Naders, dipshit. Why would a guy like Sanders ever run as a D again? You guys had your chance to save the party, now its going to be Naders all day long for your crooked party.
2016-04-24	J.S. Mack Yeah, if you purity queens don't get your way, you'll vote for a spoiler. At least you admit what you really want, not progress, just the fairy tale that politics is really all about being absolutely right instead of being effective. It's why the left in America can't win. When it's all about absolutist principles, you don't fight so much as throw your legs up in the air because your guy loses.Politics is about compromise and teamwork, not maxmialist ideologies imposing their agendas.

2016-04-24	I have no love for Saudi Arabia, but we are running out of countries in that region who align with our strategic interests. Unless we aspire to becomse like, say Canada, or Ireland, and cede control of international waterways and airways to the likes of China and Russia, we should not be turning acts of war into windfalls for tort lawyers. Think too of all of the lawsuits against United States citizens— and many of our enlisted personnel— that could arise from our acts of the last fifteen years. Moreover, an American court of law is not a place to discover truth— it is a cage match where the rules allow contestants to conceal their weakest points and exagerrate their strongest ones, using incitement and passion to sway a jury. This is not about discovering truth— it is about the enrichment of a few lawyers trolling for business.

2016-04-24	i am a proud democrat, but i agree with you on this. its certainly not a novel idea, at least to me, that saudi arabia was behind 9-11. i always believed they funded the terrorists ability to hide in plain site in this country. bin laden was born there, educated there and was radicalized long before fighting in afghanistan. i disagree with president obama and support the release of the evidence from the hearings being released to the country. i realize they are supposed to be our "ally" but they are far from that. would it be a sticky diplomatic problem for him? i think knowledge of what really happened on 9-11 is far more important.
2016-04-24	Sam Correction: They refuse to smear an entire religion because of the radicalization of a faction.
2016-04-24	Joan Smith uummm...the people who were arrested for dancing on the roofs on 9/11 were Israelis. According to witnesses, they had set up a camera to film the twin towers PRIOR to the towers being hit. How do you reconcile that with the involvement of Saudi Arabia? Were they working with The Israelis?
2016-04-24	Thousands of American architects and engineers and scientists are petitioning the govt for an independent inquiry into 9/11 stating that the findings of the Bush/Cheney inquiry are deeply flawed and contradict the laws of physics and science. Go to www.ae911truth.org to view their petition, and see the video that underlines thier belief that in fact the World Trade Center towers were brought down by controlled demolition, which could only have happened with the fore knowledge and support of the owners of the buildings.

I detest Bush/Cheney but I do not and will not believe they plotted against their country. Bush's actions were out of ineptitude and ignorance of warnings, not through malevolence.

We had that experiment with alcohol and all it did was make the damaging chemical more popular than ever including people willing to go to jail over it. We did it again with recreational drugs and its the scourge of our society. We limit cigarettes just enough to keep it contained and banning it will just see its revival. People are stupid about such things, not smart like Bernie. By all means tax it to reduce consumption, but banning it is counter-productive.

2016-04-24	Let's talk about "disenfranchising voters." Trump won 33% of the popular vote in South Carolina, but got 100% of the delegates. 67% of South Carolina voters were "disenfranchised." Is Trump giving back those delegates? Same with Arizona and Florida, where Trump got less than 50% of the popular vote but 100% of the delegates -- more than half of Arizona and Florida voters were disenfranchised. And in New York Trump got 60% of the popular vote but more than 90% of the delegates. In all, Trump got more than 100 delegates he did not earn through the popular vote. When Trump gives up these unearned delegates, he can complain about "disenfranchising" GOP voters. Until then, Trump has been the main beneficiary of disenfranchisement.

I think it should be a red flag to the voters that this guy focuses more on NOT getting things done than he does developing ideas, building relationships, etc. in order to accomplish change. Based on his Senate history, along with this behavior, voters can only imagine how little he'll accomplish by antagonizing Congress with his behavior.

2016-04-24	Steve Woods so the big voting discrepency occured in the bronx (which has been explained if you care to look) and hillary won the bronx with 60% of the vote there so if there was any shenanigans going on, it hurt hillary and not bernie. maybe we should investigate bernie?
2016-04-24	Steve Woods That's not voter suppression. All those people had to do was register as a Democrat before the deadline. It's called a PARTY nomination for a reason.
2016-04-24	It's up to those who oppose women's health. This should never be up to anyone but the woman involved. SCOTUS ruled on this long ago.
2016-04-24	And SCOTUS ruled on a fraudulently brought case. Should it be the choice of the woman? I happen to believe that it should. But, I also happen to believe that SCOTUS should have established that there are limits...much like they did with the 2nd Amendment. PP and NOW would love Abortion on Demand for any reason at any time. Most Americans do not agree with that.
2016-04-24	Lorielle Sisson The limits on the 2nd amendment don't seem to go very far or mean very much. Abortion is not decided by mob rule. I don't care what 'most Americans' think about it. It's not their business but the woman involved. I support PP and women's health and I don't need America's opinion on it.

2016-04-24	IMO that is partly why the party is sliding into irrelevance, no exceptions on any subject; not walking the walk when it is their time of need.
2016-04-24	Who really cares what their platform is. Trump will make his own decisions and to hell with the RNC. Honestly, why should he support anything in their platform if he does not agree? What have they EVER done for him?
2016-04-24	Trump is such a bad candidate, that Hillary could beat him even if she was sent to jail (which she won't). You can't alienate as many demographics as Trump and expect to be president.
2016-04-24	The point is they never should have left him run as a Republican as he has shown time and time again that he is basically a Democrat. He is totally destroying the party for his own ego.
2016-04-24	Why is he bothering to call himself a Republican?
2016-04-24	right on Priebus.....Doe v. Bolton (which allowed abortion for any reason up to birth because language says "physical emotional, psychological , familial, and the woman's age" - all the so-called "health" reaosns that NOW AND HAVE EXISTED FOR ABORTION ON DEMAND FOR 43 years!) is a charade..and Trump doesnt even realize that this two-additional exceptions is irrelevant and a non-issue....He better start boning up on the life issue....He WONT win the millions of pro-lifers by gumming up th e works.....and confusing people .....
2016-04-24	Schu Montgomery, your comment is one of the reasons republicans won't win the white house for years to come.
2016-04-24	Abortion should have always been a private issue and is not to be left up to the mob. SCOTUS has already ruled on this.
2016-04-24	Wayne Maynard SCOTUS was WRONG! They made a decision based upon a lie. That supposed "rape" of Norma McCorvey ( the "Jane Roe" of Roe vs. Wade) never happened. She admitted that she was instructed to lie in order to put forth a test case.   As usual, horrible lies lead to even more horrible deaths.
2016-04-24	I love how Trump is able to change the platform and drive policy in the Republican Party! Nobody was saying crap about a wall before trump! Now Cruz wants to build a wall! Trump says he wants a ban on Muslims entering the country, Cruz then comes back with a "policing Muslim communities" proposal! Seems as though trump says these off the wall things, trump takes the heat for it, then Cruz repeats it! Quite laughable! Now he even has the party changing their positions or accepting them! See what happens when the people's voices are heard and not the politicians trying to save their seat!
2016-04-24	So you really don't support Kasich or you really don't support Trump or anyone else. You just want to be able to sit on the fence. Could get your balls hung up though when you finally get off that fence. Typical Republican.
2016-04-24	you are stupid, wald...and crass.....You missed his whole point...strategy man,,,,making this horrible situation of NOT having Rubio as the nominee...better.....Inhofe is using his brain....dummy....
2016-04-24	Schu Montgomery and he's being honest. people say they want honesty from politicians but when they get it they can't handle it. one of donnie's biggest problems. he's too honest.
2016-04-24	Schu Montgomery, did Inhofe bring his pet snowball with him for this announcement?
2016-04-24	INHOFE IS RIGHT! Making the most out of a bad situation for sure.....If we have to have Trump, Trump should see that either Rubio (who wont take it) or Kasich is our only salvation out of this one....Ohio will vote Republican....only under that scenario.
2016-04-24	Schu Montgomery, Florida won't.....election over!!!
2016-04-24	Agreed. Right now I can't see ever voting for Trump but Kasich as VP could maybe change that. As VP I bet Trump would make him the "work horse" in his administration
2016-04-24	Gerald Vimont I don't believe his ego will allow that....
2016-04-24	After trashing all of his opponents for the nominaton, it's going to be hard to Trump to select any of them as a running mate and next in line to the Presidency. According to Trump, Walker and Kasich couldn't even run their states. Cruz is a liar and Little Marco isobviously not big enough for the job.
2016-04-24	donald trolling doesnt need none of them anyway the primarys are done
2016-04-24	donald trump dont care about ted cruz
2016-04-24	TRUMP offers voters measurable achievable solutions to take back America for ALL Americans. TRUMP possesses every necessary attributes required to address today’s challenges and tomorrows solutions. The choices are obvious; back TRUMP a winner, or back Clinton the assumed heir to the Throne!      Presidential traits: Being arrogant, condescending and reeking of a superiority complex. Useless at best! TRUMP is perfect just the way he is. He tells it like it is. To those who don’t like TRUMP you just need to get over yourselves and think past your own arrogance.

2016-04-24	For the life of me, I can't figure out why is it so bad to give people a second chance after they've paid their debt to society! If they continue to live that negative lifestyle, they will be back in jail, unable to vote! But if they've turned a corner in their life and live within the boundaries of our democracy and society, letting them vote might actually bring more people in the democratic system! I don't see what's wrong with that.
2016-04-24	Particularly the ones in on non-violent drug offenses, why not try to re-integrate them into society?
2016-04-24	For decades, Republicans insisted that taxpayers should spend millions of dollars a year so felons could be "relieved of disability" of not being able to legally possess firearms, but Heaven forbid that felons should be allowed to vote. Republicans always said that they would trust a felon with a gun, before they would trust them with a ballot.
2016-04-24	Would yuo be for restoring their gun rights as well? I notice the carpetbagger didn't do that, thank God
2016-04-24	Democrats will earn their vote they way they earn the votes of all the special interests who support them: buy them.

2016-04-24	LOL Republicans are such scumbags. The only reason they don't allow felons to vote is so they can have their racist police forces arrest every black person they can find and give them a criminal record.      Thats how the New Jim Crow keeps the black man from voting.      They also like to close polling stations in black communities so voting takes 8 hours and require voter IDs...and then close DMV offices so they can't even get the IDs without driving 200 miles round trip.
2016-04-24	You are a very sick person.
2016-04-24	Dan Bronson Actually I feel great today.
2016-04-24	Every registered voter has the option of voting by mail - no polling stations, no voter ID, no hassles with DMV's. BTW when Repubs close all those DMV's, how far to white people have to drive?

2016-04-24	Crazy Cruz's character doesn't need any one to defame it! That happens everytime he opens his mouth!
2016-04-24	Rory Houlihan Trump's character is not a good one.All he does is complain about other candidates.
2016-04-24	Rory Houlihan I am not a Cruz fan. Although I do at least know where he stands on issues and Cruz is consistent with his beliefs. I can't say the same for Donald.
2016-04-24	Trump Jr. Keeping up the family tradition of being a liberal liar and con man. Trump you had me for a short while till you started lying and calling other candidates other names. The last straw was when you said you could kill someone and probably get away with it. That is how Hitler and Stalin started out.
2016-04-24	The apple doesn't rot far from the tree
2016-04-24	Interesting. Hillary could sweep again on Tuesday.
2016-04-24	Not enough polling on RI to really put a stick in the ground there.
2016-04-24	Gregory Barnhill True, but reports were that Bernie was leading there.
2016-04-24	It's possible.
2016-04-24	Hillary could win all 5 on Tuesday
2016-04-24	Hillary probaby WILL win all 5 states on Tuesday and Bernie Sanders must accept the writing on the wall. I don't mean drop out of the primary now. No, he should stay in it until the last primary, as Clinton did 8 years ago, out of respect for his supporters.      However, after being swept Tuesday he should:      a. Cut out the shrill rhetoric that we've heard over the lasta few weeks. Chill.   b. Begin secret negotiations with Clinton over the price of his active support after the last primary.      Sanders has a very valuable product to sell - his millions of young supporters - and he should use that to get as many policy concessions (convention and general election) from Clinton as he can. I mean, he has to be a grown up about this: Hillary isn't going to clone Bernie's platform. But he SHOULD play hard to get.      Then, once he has received a reasonable payoff, he should campaign actively for Hillary.
2016-04-24	Hillary hasn't played her Elizabeth Warren card yet - but it's coming and sure to assuage many of Bernies followers.
2016-04-24	Very well said, David; I concur completely.
2016-04-24	David Kent sounds reasonable to me but I'm not getting a lot of reasonable vibes from Bernie but we'll see how it goes I guess.
2016-04-24	Interesting. Most people have expected Trump to have much more support than indicated in this poll. But so many undecided, I don't know what to make of that. Also interesting is that Trump has lost support since the last poll was taken (also Brown, late Feb.) even though the race has consolidated since then. Further breaking down the numbers, it appears that Kasich has by far the most support from "leaners". This could mean a couple of things. One, that his support is fragile and could leave him. Or, that he is the most popular candidate among those who are less sure and the late-deciders, which could see his support grow as these people finally make up their minds. All in all, this poll may be prove to be off come Tuesday. Or perhaps we will have a much tighter RI race than expected. Will be interesting.
2016-04-24	I hate to burst the bubbles of all the low IQ head bangers that are rallying behind their the lying, two-faced, wife beating, cowardly/punk-ass Vietnam draft-dodger hero Trump but, when that lyin’ SOB get’s out here to good ol’ California, we’ve got some bad news for him and, his KKK buddies!

2016-04-24	The Koch brothers have a lot of places to go. Many Republican victories in 2010 and 2014 at all levels of government were attributable to the Kochs contributions to the right candidate at the right time. They are having a huge influence on Republican politics and they have ten times as much money as Trump.
2016-04-24	Question to middle to low income repub voter: why is it that Repubs talk increasing energy supply ad nauseum, and drill babt drill, and this is what we have on gas prices the past 30 years   - Clinton $1.31 Average gas price   - Bush - $3.27   - Obama - $1.93   Repubs talk drill and reward oil comapnies withteh largest profit in a quarter in history. Dems talk conservation and alternatives increase from 4% to 12% reducing demand and deliver better gas prices. For more weeping and gnashing of teeth by ethe end of the next 8 years again, vote Repub. You've obviously forgotten 2008 compared to the past 7 years.
2016-04-24	Funny, the Koch brothers created Donald Trump

2016-04-24	Trump's polices are grasping at straws, saying whatever he thinks will get the mob cheering. He is intellectually lazy as with his idea to allow South Korea and Japan to have nuclear weapons and save us a couple of bucks in defending them. Our defense costs will sky rocket as other nations in Asia are forced into a nuclear arms race and make the world a powder keg. Anyone who spent any time thinking about nuclear weapons would see the folly of his recommendation. I guess it was one of his off the top of his head ideas and this we want for a leader? Charles Koch is right to be concerned.

Even if she does hit the magic number which she still hasn't, the party has changed as a result. Im sure your grateful that all those independents weren't allowed to vote in many of those states.

2016-04-25	Kevin Cunningham Figures, another oldie that doesn't know what they are talking about.      The votes are not there because of suppressive voting laws, not because there is a lack of people willing to vote. Any state that has had open elections has been a clear demonstration of who people would prefer for president. So you think that as long as only the votes that get counted are the ones that the party says they want to count, that everything is okay? Got that? Let's try again. Not everyone is voting that wants to vote.      You don't have the votes either, because of assholes like you who do nothing but attack other supporters. You have no problem saying you want us to vote in the general election, but in the primarys all you have to say is vitriol.
2016-04-25	Daniel Kennedy "Any state that has had open elections has been a clear demonstration of who people would prefer for president." Hillary has won more of these so called states.

2016-04-25	Bernie Sanders, who is not really a Democrat, may feel his candidacy has been disrespected by people who actually are Democrats.

The other option is to apparently give nominal support but not rally his supporters to the cause. The latter seems like the more likely scenario.      There's a good reason to have political parties.

A damn title does not make one a democrat. It is your ideology that makes you one. If anything the party is full of moderate tools who THINK they are democrats.
2016-04-25	There seem to be enough Democrats with sense still among us. Our tea partiers have already told us, they'll never vote Hillary. They'll write in or Trump. I say get gone.
2016-04-25	If the Democrats insist on nominating Hillary then the Republicans will win in November.
2016-04-25	You must be a fearful Republican!
2016-04-25	Melissa Thieme no we just do the want a corporate shill. If you hillary people wanted a democrat all you had to do was vote for sanders. You decided not too, so now if republicans wiN it's your fault.
2016-04-25	Ed James try studying the Electoral College for presidential elections in the last two decades and you might understand why Clinton will win in Nov. On the other hand you can chose to remain ignorant. You do realize that 270 wins the election and a Democrat candidate will start out with 230-240 in their pocket.
2016-04-25	This campaign went off the rails immediately after the Wisconsin victory, really just a staggering nosedive. Now it's in complete disarray. It's clearly a leadership problem. Bernie is tired and the game has gotten too big for him.      I suspect he best listen to the professional Devine and put a bite collar on the classless Weaver. My guess is he will, but who knows? He's a stubborn and cantankerous dude...      I hope he concludes this campaign with the high standard of conduct with which he began, because it was something to behold, even for this strong Clinton supporter.
2016-04-25	Strong clinton supporter? Your support for OBVIOUS corruption is disgusting.
2016-04-25	Levi Kloiber please post links to court proceedings that have found Clinton guilty of corruption if it is so obvious. Otherwise it is you who are the liar.

2016-04-25	Senator Barry Goldwater stated in 1994 you should be afraid for religious zealots taking over the GOP. Last time I checked, Ted Cruz, his wife and father believe he was going to be President destined by God. Something like the second coming of Christ. I think that meets Senator Goldwaters vision of what is happening today.
2016-04-25	I was on the fence, but after seeing that sign I'm convinced that Cruz is the right man for the job.   He deserves to be president....of his local PTA.
2016-04-25	“ESPN fired Curt Schilling for making the rather obvious point that we should allow beautiful transgender women strangers alone in a bathroom with little boys,” Cruz said.
2016-04-25	Interesting storuy about an interesting guy. Far from blue collar, I'm an engineer business owner in FL supporting Mr. Trump and I watch the whole 'Trump supporters are white working poor' with bemusement because I know - without question - the newsies are missing the big picture. When judging the level of support this guy is getting, I htink belittling the folks who cast their vote for Trump seems downright stupid, but maybe that's just me. Anyway, come the general, all the smugness about how Secretary Clinton will destroy Trump will quickly vanish because once the backstory about her begins to come out (again) from someone unafraid of leveling the charges everyone is thinking, e.g. 'she's dirty' then watch her numbers sink like a stone.
2016-04-25	Typical Republican ideas. Rather than talking about why you vote for Trump you talk about why one would vote against Hillary. Where are Trump's ideas? Lock up the Moooooooooslims, build a wall and dig a moat, deport 11 million people, give nukes to S Korea and Japan, get rid of NATO and the UN.      Great policy ideas. At least Hillary goes into a bit more detail on her policy thoughts.      Get real John.
2016-04-25	And just what will Trump's trade war with the world do for your business?
2016-04-25	So in other words, you are waiting for a miracle to happen.
2016-04-25	Nothing like bringing back all the dirty tricks of the Nixon administration along with the hate and fear.
2016-04-25	Neal- Very True - I lived in that era and the Bernie folks think Hillary is bad......not even close. I admire Senator Sanders greatly but he has not fully gotten his message out to where it truly resonates. I can agree with some things he wants to do - Imporve helath care etc.      The question is HOW in a era where the word "Tax" is a dirty word is he going to pay for it and how is he goign to get thru a Congress that unless it is totally dominated by Democrats(and they have to be the right kind of Democrat) it may not get out.      Governing is a slow proces in mnay respects. I grew up an African American male in the South in the 1960's - we had people die trying to make change-it took 100 years from the end of the Civil War to get what we got in 1964 with the VRA and the Civil Rights Act.
2016-04-25	Roland Miller The issue is change has to start somewhere. Bernie would at least start the revolution, push for a great deal, compromise and access less. Clinton is part of the establishment, part of the problem. If you think Hillary represents your interests......she's as much part of the 1% as any Republican. In fact her policies are more in line with moderate Republicans of the 60's/70's. I see her as more like Nixon. She won't do anything to advance the values of progressives.

2016-04-25	This is frightening what I'm hearing Trump is more the megalomaniac than I first thought. He see's himself like the big face on the TV screen in those science-fiction movies telling everyone what to do. A demagogue for the masses giving direction from on high. Reality brought him back to his senses, but no place was there a discussion of issues or polices for the country? He's still all the showbiz celebrity personality at the head of his campaign. A politician for the 22nd Century as George Orwell saw it.

2016-04-25	It makes not a jot difference whether Trump/Cruz/? wins the nomination. None of them will ever be POTUS.
2016-04-25	What Trump gets right is that the GOP base is angry, racist, bigoted, and incredibly stupid.
2016-04-25	With Ted Cruz he is a liar and a religous zealot. With Donald Trump he is a liar and a right wing facist. With John Kasich depending on who you talk to. If you talk to a fringe conservative he is a RINO. If you talk to the press he is a moderate. Funny, he is the adult in the room for the GOP but he is a reactionary. Trying to be the moderate when really he is not. And the GOP created them and they have no clue what to do with them either. The rules is now where the GOP eat their own again.
2016-04-25	The GOP system rigged but having Super Delegates is ok?   If you break down the 1237, how could anyone ever get to this number with 17 Canadates, at least it should be a 1/3 as 3 will remain in the run.   If Trump comes in with 1100 and Cruz less than 800 and they deny Trump, they basically are giving up and will wait till 2020, Cruz certainly can't win as he can't win the Republican votes on avg less than 30% .   As far as Bernie, he might give in to Clinton later but most of his supporters will not be as joyful to vote for Clinton.   This is the craziest Presidential run of my lifetime, so many things coming to light.

2016-04-25	He needs 1237 delegates to vote for him. He doesn't need 1237 pledged delegates. According to the "can you get Trump to 1,237?" page at FiveThirtyEight, there are 146 unpledged delegates. And by the "follow the experts" projection there, Trump would only need 46. He can lose two-to-one in unpledged delegates, in that scenario, but still pick up enough of them to put him over the top.
2016-04-25	So the real question is... Is this more rigged than the Democratic Superdelagate system?
2016-04-25	IMHO the dems system is more transparent whether you like the system or not. AFAIK the earned delegates aren't being maneuvered behind the scenes. The super delegates may declare a preference early, but the reality is they will flip if a candidate wins more of the earned delegates. Thats basically how Obama won in 2008. He had a plurality in earned delegates, Clinton had won the popular vote in primaries by a bit. The superdelegates went with Obama even though as I recall most had declared for Clinton at the start..The superdelegates are there to prevent a total crackpot like George McGovern f...See More

2016-04-25	Republican party brought this on themselves. They've been so dishonest for so long, it's only a matter of time until a guy (actually 2 guys) that lies as easily as he breathes sweeps the rug out from under them. Now the Democrats have to watch out so the same thing doesn't happen to them.
2016-04-25	It takes an impressive delusion to not be able to recognize that the real problem is that Republicans aren't nearly as good at being dishonest as Democrats. Lying as easily as they breath has been the platform of the Democratic party for so long that they've turned it into an art form.
2016-04-25	Scott Hamlin Bottom line. The GOP and who they sent to lead the party are filled with hatred and fear. The GOP also has demonstrated that they camn't govern demonstrated perfecrtly by looking at the House and Senate they control. Put that all together and you have disaster. The Democrats have not talked about that. They have not gotten into the gutter to talk about who urinated on whom, hand size versus penis size, whose wife is sleazier and who had the most affairs. The GOP did this all to themselves.
2016-04-25	Scott Hamlin Proving yourself an idiot appears to come quite naturally to you.
2016-04-25	as effective as Luxembourg and Belgium teaming up against France
2016-04-25	True, it is an act of desperation but I don't think it is horrible, just politics.
2016-04-25	Trump - proving what an actual idiot he really is. This is the game he decided to join. They are playing by the rules of the gain. And whiny Trump is once again whining - with an NYC flavor.
2016-04-25	His point is that this is an election for our highest office shouldn't treat the will of the voters like a game (I assume you meant game and not gain) in the first place. There shouldn't be rules that allow party's to disregard their voter's choices. Voters, not political parties, should be picking candidates.
2016-04-25	Nothing wrong with Trump pointing out ALL of the bad things about politics and politicians. WHY aren't primaries one person one vote? WHY aren't delegates allocated by the percentage a candidate wins and why are conventions held to name delegates who favor candidates other than who the voters selected? WHY isn't it illegal to grant favors to delegates in exchange for their votes? WHY isn't it illegal for candidates to collude - as Trump said, in the business world it is most often illegal? WHY do the Democrats have Superdelegates, except to control the vote if the establishment believes the voters chose wrong? Just because they are the rules of the game does not mean they are right or that they should continue to be so.
2016-04-25	Lorielle Sisson then play by the rules as they currently stand and make moves to change them after. Complaining about "fairness" in politics, especially during primaries, is hilarious. Further, complaining about the rules in a 'game' you're currently playing is ludicrous.      Alyssa, voters pick candidates in general elections. Parties are supposed to pick their nominee in primaries. They use the voters to gauge feelings, and to allow the people to select delegates. You are not voting for a candidate in the primary, you should've known that going in, and if you didn't that's YOUR FAULT.
2016-04-25	This guy needs a mental examination before any hope of being a POTUS candidate.

2016-04-25	Karen Wakefield You might take this into account before you vote:      "It is commonly believed by Clinton victims that Hillary was behind the siccing of private investigators on the many women who accused her husband of rape, sexual assault or infidelity in the 1990s.      Hillary Clinton revealed her hidden hand when she menacingly issued a clear warning of intimidation to her husband’s accusers (and those who would pursue their charges) on the nationally broadcast Today Show in early 1998 in the days after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke."
2016-04-25	Kimberly Kelly any other conspiracy theory you would like to share with us? How about 9/11?
2016-04-25	Wrong about HRC not having cross-over appeal. I know several Republicans who will vote for her over Trump. Sanders will be a footnote after the #AcelaPrimary Tuesday. Dawson will be gone. Don't forget there are 5 months for Trump to fall into the hole he's dug for himself.
2016-04-25	Agreed. Further, let's address Campaign Finance Reform for a moment. NEWS FLASH Americans: It was the Republicans in Congress who BLOCKED a proposed constitutional amendment that would limit campaign spending, which would counter the NEGATIVE effects of the Citizens United. Republicans also BLOCKED the Disclose Act, which would have required the disclosure of campaign contributions. The Republican SCOTUS ruled in favor of Citizens United (5-4) and the equally disastrous McCutcheon Ruling (5-4) of eliminating limits on the total amount people can donate to campaigns in single elections . ....See More

It works for other of like minds for awhile, but not in the end. Every day Trump digs that "presidential behavior hole" a little deeper. He doesn't have a presidential molecule in his body because he actually is a 12 year old at heart. It shows in everything he says and does. (Leave Tom Brady alone. Seriously?)
2016-04-25	David E Edwards- so true
2016-04-25	Completely remove the media moderators from question selection. Perhaps have a grab bag --- one for Dems and one for Reps --- the moderator can randomly select a question and, unless it is totally irrelevant to the campaign - ask it. All questions that were discarded as irrelevant should be posted to social media so the public can see what was rejected. There is currently so much distrust in the media that their involvement in this process is suspect. Additionally, these debates should not solely be arranged by the parties...especially since the RNC has done absolutely nothing to this point to support their front runner. The last thing that we want to see is another Candy Crowley moment of a moderator correcting a candidate on air (wrongly). It would be wonderful if we could determine a way to not involve the media in these spectacles at all.

I don't care what tribe you support, people shouldn't have to be a part of ANY tribe if you are going to take our money to pay for YOUR primary.
2016-04-25	Just another lie from the Cruz campaign.
2016-04-25	I guess you are ok with the plethora of lies coming forth from Trump...which is ok...but it does dilute your standing on the 'truth'

2016-04-25	Or the racist trump, either!!!
2016-04-25	OK! Lets try to fix stupid once again!! This whole Republican Presidential Primary Campaign season has centered around stopping Donald Trump. This is in spite of a majority of the voters who did there Civic duty and got off their duff and went to the polls and cast a ballot have voted for Donald Trump in the Republican primary. Now!! this is why Lying Ted Cruz and IDIOT LOSER Kasich will not win this election by honest means. Both of Donald Trumps remaining opponents have tunnel vision “Stop Donald Trump focus” and have totally forgotten the give any reasons WHY ANY ONE SHOULD VOTE FOR THEM!!!...See More
2016-04-25	Ron Nehring is a fine example of the nasty, sleazy scum that makes up the Cruz campaign staff. It can't be coincidence that Cruz has assembled a "Legion of Doom" full of guys like him.
2016-04-25	No it is not. I am quite sure the leadership in the RNC which is also made up of the Republican party gave the green light for this along with never trump. This demonstrates two things. First it demonstrates that neither Governor Kasich or Ted Cruz are able to take down Trump by themselve making them weak candidates coming out of a brokered convention. This only solidifies what Donald Trump has been saying that the GOP is corrupt. I have plenty of popcorn. I hope everyone does as well.

2016-04-25	Hank Marcus crawl back into your hole. Trump 2016
2016-04-25	The republican party and conservatives are going to be the ones to put Hillary in the WH. They have trashed and cussed Trump supporters so badly, that it won't take many of them to not vote republican, in the general, and I can't blame them. And Hillary will win by default. Mark Levin leading the pack to get Hillary elected. But no worry, the GOP establishment will profit, the talking heads will profit, the talk shows will profit BIG TIME. And the conservative individual will be scratching their heads. How did this happen?   People wouldn't have to be in the position to vote against Hillary, had the party put their effort into stopping her instead of the republican front runner. So save the entire vote against Hillary crap.
2016-04-25	Trump has 37% of the vote   63% wish he would F off   And thts just republicans

2016-04-25	What this does demonstrate is Governor Kasich's weakness that he can't take Donald Trump alone. The same for Ted Cruz. If either one now come out of a brokered convention they will be weak and will alienate the Trump Wing. On the other hand this will embolden Trump. Prove his point that the GOP is corrupt and he will walk into the convention with the necessary delegates and alienate the rest of the Republican party. Either way there is no real good choice. The GOP did this to themselves and also too little and too late in the game to do this.
2016-04-25	The end is near for the GOP. Suicide brought on from the Kochs when they stated the TEA party. 8 years and they destyed the party
2016-04-25	we're honest what did he steal the money that was raised for our veterans skipped the debate stealing from her veterans is the lowest of low

2016-04-25	from the wimps that are called "millennials"??? they are lazy and too full of themselves
2016-04-25	Roy Ellis Yet you're logged into Facebook created by a millenial. You're welcome!
2016-04-25	"Only 16 percent of young voters identify as socialists, and just a third support socialism. Nevertheless, Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is the only candidate with a positive net favorability: +23 percent (54 percent favorable, 31 percent unfavorable)."      Probably because they are aware that "socialism" is a term used to fearmonger, and it only works on the low-info types who don't understand what Sanders is actually proposing. If you research what Sanders is actually proposing, you will probably like it, like these millenials.
2016-04-25	Tim probably because no one has run any negative ads against Bernie. He has yet to be thoroughly vetted.
2016-04-25	Cheryl Onstad      There is nothing negative to say about Bernie that everyone hasn't already heard.      Prove me wrong. I will wait.
2016-04-25	Tim Hoefling Until someone runs negative ad(s), we will never know.
2016-04-25	Fuck Millennials

2016-04-25	If the will of the people were for Rev Cruz we the AMERICAN PEOPLE would not be having this conversation. Rev Cruz/Kasich are losing to Trump and the insiders are seeing the results.      I heard Rev Cruz speech today saying that Trump is whining however I see the opposite. I see Rev Cruz losing along with Kasich. Just by Rev Cruz/Kasich coming together Trump is hitting a nerve/ I am not a Trump fan however I agree with him this is a COLLUSION.

2016-04-25	Cruz is a liar. He believes all of this is divine intervention and he will win by divine guidence. And this is the Republican candidate that is one of the 3 that the GOP has thrown to all of us? What a mess.
2016-04-25	It's about choice? Ted Cruz has propagated a lot of lies and this is just the latest one. If it's about choice, then why remove one of the options?      Ted Cruz is a liar at heart. This electoral cartel is doing on thing, limiting choice to deny the voters' will. Neither he nor Kasich can win outright, so they are working the systems, developed by the insiders to protect the insiders.      Lest anyone think that I am a Trump supporter, I am not. However, This act of collusion will backfire on both Cruz and Kasich. Voters, whether they are Trump supporters or not, will see this for what it is, an undemocratic means to rig an elections and take away the votes of Americans.
2016-04-25	Sen. Cruz obviously has a short memory, or is even more dishonest than Trump says. Cruz normally doesn't win when the people (not insiders) vote. I suspect he and Kasich just made Trump's path to the nomination much smoother in Hoosierland. Time to get onboard, the train is leaving the station.
2016-04-25	Well, Cruz can't beat Hillary either.
2016-04-25	Trump should announce Michael Steele, and Jim Webb as the candidates on his list of VP candidates.

2016-04-25	Cruz is Canadian. Hence this latest move is like pulling the goalie, down two goals, with 1 minute left in the game. Good luck Ted!
2016-04-25	VERY DESPWERATE ARGUMENT. CRUZ WAS ABOUT 4 YEARS OLD OR SO WHEN HE LEFT CANADA WITH HIS AMERICAN MOTHER AND SO I'M SURE THAT WAS A BIG INFLUENCE.
2016-04-25	Monica Walker Mimier Just a joke .. I'm Canadian, hence the hockey metaphor. Believe me we're VERY pleased he renounced his Canadian citizenship. It's obvious though our more liberal, kinder, gentler values had little influence on him by age 4.

2016-04-25	Dan Cline Cruz and Kasich should have made this deal earlier and Cruz should have told his supporters in New York to vote for Kasich. The same thing goes for most the primaries tomorrow. These men's egos combined with Trump's candidacy will result in the destruction of the republican party.

2016-04-25	Time for Sestak to realize that when he lost against lamebrain Pat Toomey, he lost the confidence of the Democratic Senate Committee and Obama as well. Need new blood in PA.
2016-04-25	Ed, you are ill informed!! Sestak barely lost in a year when most all Dems were swamped!! The Philly bosses [ Bob Brady} want someone they can control & Sestek is not that person but Mcginty certainly is.She has NEVER held elective office tho she did run for Governor & finished last. This tells me Gov Wolfe is nothing more than a shill f or the Philly bosses. I now realize my vote for Wolfe was a mistake!!
2016-04-25	Douglas Trower ANYONE that can lose to can-of-dog-food Pat Toomey is not someone I want to trust with running a very, very important race. Sestak has earned a reputation as an unpredictable, troublesome, prickly "independent" sort of person, who does not run a modern, well-planned, well-managed campaign and who has trouble working with people. Who needs that?   McGinty has the full support of my President, the support of Ed Rendell, the support of Emily's list, the support of AP's Labor Unions, and that all means a lot to me. Go, Katie!
2016-04-25	I still haven't decided between Sestak and Fetterman. But no way I'm voting for McGinty. The fa t that the party is backing her so hard is all I really need to know to know that she's a faux-liberal. The ironic thing is that Sestak polls far better against Toomey than she does. Dems don't care though, they just want a kiss ass and Sestak won't always play their games. Fetterman is a great guy but he just doesn't have a shot. He had no money so that's that.
